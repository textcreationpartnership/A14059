            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the wyſe Philoſopher <hi>Seneca,</hi> counteth him to ſlay or kill, that may well ſaue and will not: ſo may I rightly iudge after the ſame faſhion, that he is a great hindrer and hurter that may profite a man and will not. Seeing then that this my fathers Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball, which he after his long trauell, ſtudy and experience hath made, is now ſet forth to profit and pleaſure his countrimen withall: and by the ouerſight partly of the Printer, and partly of the Scribe that copied the booke out for the Printer, is now ſo commed forth that the Reader can not get any profite or commoditie thereof: leaſt that I for the cauſe aboue reherſed bee counted a hinderer of the profite of my Countriemen, and not to ſet by my Fathers fame and eſtimation (for I am ſure, many that know not that afore his death he went about to correct this booke, will blame him for letting ſo falſly a printed booke to come forth) I haue taken ſome paynes, and haue pervſed and red ouer this booke as my Father beganne, and haue conferred it with his owne hande copie, and haue ſo corrected it and amended it, that a diligent and a welwilling reader may eaſily vnderſtand the meaning of the writer, and ſo take great profit of the ſame. But peraduenture ſome will ſaye, if I had minded to pleaſure my Countriemen, I might haue done better if I had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in or ſtayed this print, and cauſed the booke to haue bene printed here anew again. In dede if I had done ſo, I ſhould haue eaſed the reader of this labour of correcting. But I ſhould haue done againſt Charitie to haue cauſed the Printer by that meanes to leſe all his labor and coſt which he hath beſtowed in printing hereof. Wherfore gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reader beare a little with the Printer that neuer was much accuſtomed to the printing of Engliſhe, and afore thou reade ouer this booke, correct it as I haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and then the profite thereof will aboundantly recompence thy paynes. And laſt of all, take theſe my paynes alſo in good worth at this time. Another daye when this Herball ſhall be printed againe (and if it pleaſe God to lend me lyfe and health, augmented and increaſed) I truſt the reader ſhalbe put to no ſuch paines in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of the ſame, as in no other of my fathers bookes as yet vnprinted which hereafter as time and occaſion ſhall ſerue, I entende to ſet forth. In the meane time vſe this Herball in ſtede of a better, and giue all laude and prayſe vnto the Lorde.</p>

There are thre kindes of Wormwode after the iudgements of Dioſcorides / Galene / Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny / Aetius / and Paulus Egineta. The fyrſte kind is called Abſinthium Ponticum / Dioſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corides deſcribeth not abſinthium Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum / as an herbe well knowen in hys tyme euen vnto the common people. Which thinge hath bene the cauſe / that of late yeares it hath bene ſo litle knowen of the Phiſicians both in Italy and in Germanye / and in manye other countrees. Howbeit a diligent and witty man might haue gathered of Dioſcorides / where he compareth in diuerſe places Abſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thium Ponticum and other herbes together in likenes of leaues and bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches / that this common Wormwode whiche hath bene longe taken for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:18352:9"/> Pontike Wormwode / was not the Pontike wormwode that Dioſcori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des meant of. For in the deſcription of oure common Sothernwod / he ſayeth that it hath ſmall braunches lyke Wormwod / that is to ſaye / Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike Wormwode: and in the deſcription of Santonik Wormwod he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes that it is not vnlyke vnto Wormwode / meaninge thereby as I ſayed before / Pontike wormwode. Then he that knoweth well by the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Dioſcorides / ether Sothernwode or Santonike wormwode / maye thereby metely well knowe Pontike wormwode / or at the leſt that this common Wormwood is not the righte Pontike wormwode / becauſe the braunches are not lyke. But Galene perceyuinge in hys tyme that the ignorance of the righte Wormwode Pontike began to come in / belyke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Dioſcorides went ouer it vndeſcribed in the eleuenth boke <hi>De methodo medendi</hi> / fulfilleth perfectly it that Dioſcorides left oute / in theſe wordes followinge: When as there is in euery Wormwod a duble poure / in Pontike wormwode is no ſmall binding propertye / in all other Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wodes a verye vehement bitter qualitie. But as for aſtriction or bindinge / which a man can perceyue by taſte / is ether verye harde to be founde / or ellis none at all. Wherefore Pontike Wormwode oughte to be choſen for the inflammationes of the lyuer. But it hath muche leſſe floures and leaues then other Wormwodes / and the ſmelle of thys is not onelye not vnpleaſant / but reſembleth a certeyne ſpicines or pleaſant ſauor / all other haue a verye foule ſmell. Galene alſo in the ſixt boke of Simple medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes writeth / that Pontike wormwod is not ſo hote as the other kindes of Wormwode be / and that it is more bindinge then bitter. By thys de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Galene it is playne that the herbe whiche is called in the Weſt parte of Englande / Herbe cypres / about London Wormwod Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man / in Freſeland / Cypreskruyt / or wilde Roſmarine / of the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Anwerpe / and of Meſue Abſinthium Romanum / and of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lones Graue cruyt / is the right Abſinthium Ponticum / and that the great bitter ſtinking common Wormwod / is not the Wormwod that Galene taketh / and teacheth to be taken for Wormwode Pontike. For the hole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription agreeth wyth the litle Wormwode Roman / and diſagreeth wyth the common great leaued Wormwod / as euerye indifferent man that hath ſene / taſted / ſmelled / and compared the herbes with the deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption / can beare witnes. But Matthiolus whome the Spanyarde A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matus foloweth / holdeth not withſtandinge theſe wordes of Galene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue rehearſed / that oure common great Wormwod / is righte Pontike wormwod / hys wordes are theſe: Some of later writers leaninge vnto the authorite of Galene <hi>libro ſecundo de methodo medendi</hi> / that Pontike wormwode differeth muche in kinde from it that groweth in oure coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre / euen as Santonike and Sea wormwod do differ. But I for my parte do beleue / that they differ in no otherwiſe / but that Pontike by the reaſon of the clyme and complexion of the region where it groweth / hath leſſe floures and leaues then oures hath / and for the ſame cauſe I beleue that it excelles oures alſo both in bindinge and alſo in ſauor or ſmellinge / whyche thinge Galene in the ſixte boke of Simple medicines / where as he intreateth of Sothernwod / doeth ſufficientlye declare / when he ſayeth / there are two kindes of Sothernwod / the one which they call the male / and the other which they call the female / whiche thinge is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18352:9"/> by Dioſcorides and Pamphilus / and infinit mo. But Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wod is an other thinge / differinge from Sothernwode: and of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wode we muſt determine that there are thre kindes / of the whiche there is one that hath hys name of his kinde or countreye / as is called Pontike wormwode / the other Santonike / the thirde Seriph or Sea Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wode. Wherefore Dioſcorides iudged well / where as in the kinde of common Wormwode he gaue the chefe prayſe vnto Pontike. The ſame Matthiolus writeth alſo theſe wordes. There are thre kindes of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wode intreated of here of Dioſcorides / that is to wet / oure common Wormwode / Sea wormwod whiche they call Seriphium / and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonike / whereof France nexte vnto the Alpes hath great plenty. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Matthiolus is a learned man / and therefore by the opinion of his learninge euen wythoute good reaſon and autorite maye drawe other after him in to his error: for the defence of the trueth / I will confute hys error both wyth reaſon and ſufficient authorite. Where he ſayeth that Dioſcorides intreateth of thre kindes of Wormwod / and that he intreateth fyrſte of / is oure common Wormwod. In the beginninge he ſwarueth from the trueth / for the fyrſte kinde of Wormwode that Dioſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corides intreateth of / is Pontike wormwode. But the common Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wode is not Pontike wormwode: the beſte Pontike Wormwode / as Dioſcorides ſayeth / groweth in Ponto in Cappadocia / and in the hill called Taurus / and in the deſcription of Abrotoni / he maketh Abrotonum the female lyke vnto Sea Wormwode / and the male lyke in ſmallnes of the littel braunches vnto Wormwode. Where as Wormwod doutles ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth Pontike wormwode / for Wormwod rehearſed alone wythoute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye addicion / is euer taken for Pontike Wormwod / becauſe it is more excellent / then all other Wormwodes be. But the common Wormwod groweth not in mountaynes or wilde hilles / but onelye aboute tounes / diches / hyghe wayes / and in tilled and labored grounde / nether is it lyke vnto oure common Sothernwod / whiche is the male in Dioſcorides / for it hath ſtalkes / leaues and braunches / ten tymes greater then Abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonum the male hath / as euerye man maye ſe / that will compare the one wyth the other / Therefore this common greate Wormwode that groweth onelye aboute tounes / diches / and in tilled groundes wyth a leafe and braunches / ten tymes greater then Sothernwod / can not be Abſinthium Ponticum of Dioſcorides. It is not therefore truely ſayeth of Matthiolus / that the fyrſte kinde of Wormwod that Dioſcorides in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth of / is the common Wormwode that groweth commonlye in Italye / whiche is the common Wormwode both of Germanye and of Fraunche / of Englande / and of Scotlande. Becauſe Dioſcorides deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth not Pontike wormwode / as an herbe in hys tyme well ynough knowen / euen vnto the common ſorte. If anye other Autentike author deſcribeth Pontike wormwod at large / we ought to beleue him / and to take that for Pontike wormwode / whyche diſagreeth wyth hys deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. But where as Dioſcorides lefte Pontike wormwode vndeſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed / the noble Phiſician Galene / who practiſed Phiſick / not onelye in Grecia / but alſo in Rome / deſcribed Abſinthium Ponticum verye dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlye / wherefore we muſt take that onelye for Pontike wormwode / 
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18352:10"/> that agreeth not wyth hys deſcription. But this common Wormwode a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth not wyth the deſcription of Galene of Pontike wormwode / there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thys common Wormwod is not the Pontike wormwode. Galene in the deſcription of Pontike wormwode ſayeth that in Pontike worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wode is no ſmall bindinge qualitie. In all other Wormwoddes the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter qualite is moſte exceadinge and greateſt. Pontike wormwode hath a leafe and a floure muche leſſe then the other haue / the ſmell alſo of the ſame is not onelye not vnpleaſant / but alſo reſembling in ſmell a certeyne ſpice. But all the other haue a ſtinkinge or foule ſmell. Theſe are Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes wordes: But the common great wormwod is bytterer then all other Wormwoddes / it hath a greater leafe and floure / then anye other / and it ſtinketh alſo more then anye other Wormwod / therefore of all other it is fartheſt from Pontike wormwod. I knowe thre ſortes of Wormwode beſyde the common / the right Sea wormwode / the ſmale Wormwode that groweth in the olde walles and ruines of Rome / and the thyrde ſorte / that groweth in Gardines in Englande / and in the fieldes aboute Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and Spyer in Germanye. All theſe thre ſortes haue leſſe leaues and floures / and a better ſmell then the common Wormwod hath. Therefore if Matthiolus had regarded as he oughte to haue done the authorite of Galene / he ſhoulde haue taken anye of theſe thre / or at the leſt two of them rather for Pontike wormwod / then the common wormwode / na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely when as he hath ſene theſe two ſortes of Wormwod / the one in Rome and the other ether in Italy or in Germany / or at the leſt deſcribed in the la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter writers of the Germanes / vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of Abrotoni feminee / and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallye in Fuchſio and in Hieronymo Trago / where he ſayeth that the cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me or nature of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> countreye maketh ſuch diuerſite and difference betwene the wormwod Pontik and the Wormwod of Italy / which he can no other waye proue / but by onlye geſſinge: Then when ther is ſuch diuerſite and dif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ference of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> clyme and of the nature of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> countre betwene Rome and Freſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land / and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fartheſt parte of Englande / then ſhoulde ther be ſome notable diuerſite betwene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> comon wormwod of England and Freſeland / and the comon Wormwod of Italy. But ther is no difference at all betwene them / nether in qualite nor quantite that a man may perceyue / ye and if ther were any ſuche notable difference / how chaunſeth it that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Wormwod growinge in Germany both in the fieldes and alſo in gardins / and the Wormwode y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> groweth in Rome beſyde the temple of Peace / and in diuerſe other places of the olde walles and ruines of the cytie / are nothing at all / or at the leſt but a littel differinge from the quantite and qualite of Pontike worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wode. And yet the common Wormwod if it were wormwod Pontike / or a kinde of it / ſhoulde differ ſo farre both in quantite and alſo in diuerſe qualities from the right and naturall Pontike wormwod / Surely euen if he coulde proue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it were a kinde of Pontike wormwod (which thinge he ſhall neuer be able to do) it muſt nedes folowe that it were the worſt of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thre kindes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are in Italye. Then lett wyſe men iudge how rightly Mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thiolus iudgeth in this matter / when he refuſing ether / or if I ſhould ſaye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beſt / not knowinge theſe two better ſortes / aloweth this euell fauored and ſtinkinge common Wormwode / namelye when as Galene expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly condemneth thys greate ſtinkinge and bitter kinde of Wormwod / 
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18352:10"/> and aloweth it with the ſmaler leaues / and better and pleaſanter ſmell. Matthiolus as though he had proued his purpos well with his gloſe of the diuerſite of the clymes and natures of the groundes / ſayeth alſo theſe wordes. Galene ſayeth in the ſixt boke of ſimple medecines: Sothernwod is a fare other thinge from Wormwod / and of wormwod are thre kindes / wherof they call one by the ſame kinde or countre name / wher it groweth. Whereof the Pontik is the beſt. The ſecond they call Seriphium / and the thirde Santonicum / wherefore me thinke that Dioſcorides iudged well when in the kindes of comon Wormwod / he commended Pontike aboue the reſt. This is the ſayinge of Matthiolus / If that Dioſcorides ſayed wel / becauſe Galene ſayed the ſame after him as though Dioſcorides makinge thre kindes of Wormwod / and prayſing moſt Pontik wormwod / had not done well / if Galene had not alowed it that Dioſcorides had written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. If that the autorite of Galene be ſo great with Matthiolus / why doth he alowe amongeſt the kindes of Wormwod / for Pontike wormwod that kinde that Galene of all other moſt diſprayſeth &amp; commandeth to excheue / and taketh awaye from the kindes of Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tike wormwode / in theſe wordes / All other Wormwods / ſauing Pontik wormwod haue a foule ſmell and a greater leafe and floure then Pontike hath: wherefore they ought to be fled / and Pontike to be receyued. But I wote whye he prayſeth Dioſcori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des / that is becauſe he ſemeth to geue him a <hi>maior</hi> or ſure grounde to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke an argument that this comon Wormwode muſt nedes be Pontike or a kinde of Pontike Wormwod / and he ſemeth to reaſon priuely thus: Both Dioſcorides and Galene make no more kindes of Wormwod but thre: but this great kinde of como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Wormwode is nether Sea wormwod nor San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick wormwod. Therefore it foloweth that it is Pontick wormwod / or a kinde of it. Fyrſte vnto this argument I anſwer / that it is no good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Dioſcorides maketh onely thre kindes of Wormwod / <hi>ergo</hi> there are only thre kindes of Wormwood / and no more. For as Dioſcorides doth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally deſcribe diuers kindes of herbes / that other haue not touched: ſo di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerſe autentike and noble writters do deſcribe diuers kindes of herbes / whereof he hath made no mencion at all. Theophraſtus who wrote longe before Dioſcorides / deſcribeth a kinde Bruthalaſſij / in likenes and qualite and quantite / muche differing from it that Dioſcorides deſcribeth / where as Dioſcorides maketh no mencion. But of one kinde of Sorbus / and yet deſcribeth it not: Pliny that wrote muche of him / maketh mencion of foure diuerſe kindes / and deſcribeth them / where Dioſcorides maketh but one kinde of Betoni. Paulus Egineta that came after him a longe tyme / ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth two kindes / whereof the one is nothinge at all lyke the other / Where Dioſcorides maketh but one kinde of Aſhe / Theophraſtus maketh two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe and ſeuerall kindes. Auerrois maketh mencion of a kinde of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wode / which he calleth Abſinthiolum / whereof there is no mencion in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſcorides / And Auicenna maketh fyue kindes of Wormwode / where as Dioſcorides and Galene make but thre kindes / wherefore it foloweth not / becauſe Dioſcorides and Galene make but thre kindes of Wormwode / <hi>ergo</hi> there are but thre kindes of Wormwode. Yea if there were but onely thre kindes of Wormwod / yet it ſhould not folowe ſtreyght / that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Wormwod ſhould be vnder the kinde of Pontike Wormwod: Naye / it ſhould folowe that it ſhould be a kinde of See wormwod / or Santonik
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18352:11"/> Wormwod rather then Pontike Wormwod or anye kinde of it / becauſe Galene maketh all kindes of Wormwode greater leued and floured / and more ſtinkinge then Pontike Wormwode. Therefore when as this great comon Wormwod is greater and more ſtinkinge then anye other Wormwode is / it muſte nedes be farreſt awaye from the kinde of Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike Wormwode / and ſo rather a kinde of Sea Wormwod or San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonike Wormwode / and eſpeciallye of Santonike / becauſe Santo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia is nerer Italye / Germanye / and England / then Pontus is / in whiche countres by the more likenes of the clymes and nerenes of the countres / it is more likely that there ſhoulde be more plentye of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonike Wormwod then Pontike. <hi>Gerhardus de VVijck,</hi> twelue yeares ago / when as he was in Colon at that tyme the Emperours Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry / taught me fyrſte the righte Pontike Wormwode. Thys man was well learned in Greke / Latine / and Hebrew / and was ſo earneſt a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of ſimpels when he was in Italy / that he went into the mount Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pennine wyth manye other / to finde oute ſimpleſſe / whereof he onelye wyth two or thre other eſcaped death / for all the other dyed ether in there yorneye / or ſhortely after that they came home. Thys ſame man tolde me that after his laborſum and perillous iorney / he fell into a dropſy / and that by vſinge of Romiſh or Pontike Wormwod / whiche he founde in Italye / he was delyuered from his dropſye. But it was not the common Wormwode / but Abſinthium Romanum that the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries of Anwerpe vſe / and is called Graue cruyt. This noble clerke afterwarde was ſente by Charles the fyft / Embaſſator to the greate Turke / and in his iorneye he came thorowe Pontus / and broughte home wyth hym trewe Rapontike / whereof manye haue douted manye a daye / The ſame clerke after he came home from Pontus / ſeynge a frende of hys writinge agaynſt them that helde that Graue cruyt of the coloures / ſhoulde be Abſinthium Ponticum / reproued hym and made him in the ſeconde ſettinge furth of his boke / call back hys former opinion / and write that Abſinthium Romanum Antuerpien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſium and Colonienſium / was the trewe Pontik and Romiſh Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wod. Then if it be trewe that Plautus ſayeth / <hi>Pluris eſt oculatus te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtis vnus, quàm auriti decem:</hi> men ought rather to beleue Gerardus in this matter then Matthiolus. A certayne Spanyard / ſomtyme called Ioannes Rodericus / and afterward I can not tell by what chaunge named Amatus Luſitatus / a verye ape vnto Matthiolus / but muche behinde him in learninge / who ſemeth to haue taken a great parte of his boke oute of the Italian Commentaries of Matthiolus / writteth thus of Wormwod Pontike. The common Wormwode is all one wyth Pontike and Romiſhe Wormwode / for they differ in nothinge but in the naturall place of their growinge / whereby it chaunſed that Galene in his bookes <hi>De methodo medendi</hi> / mighte ſeme to make them ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme diuerſe herbes / when as they are but all one herbe / <hi>&amp; caet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If Amatus had ben Pythagoras / and we hys ſcollares / we woulde haue ben content wyth hys onely ſayinge / that the common Wormwod was Pontike Wormwode / withoute anye requiringe of further autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite or reaſons to proue thys ſayinge wythall. But ſeynge that he is nether Pythagoras / nor we hys ſcollares / we require both authorite
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18352:11"/> and reaſon to proue that the common Wormwod is Wormwode Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike / and becauſe we finde nether of both fitt to hys ſayinge / we do not receaue this ſayinge for Apollones aunſwere: Naye / becauſe it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye both vnto Dioſcorides and Galene / we take his iudgement to be vntrewe and in no wiſe to be followed. He ſayeth that the common Wormwode agreeth in all thinges wyth Pontike Wormwode / ſauinge onelye in the naturall place of growinge. But thys ſaynge is quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſte the ſaynge of Galene <hi>in vndecimo libro methodi medendi:</hi> where he ſayeth that in all other Wormwodes / ſauinge in Pontike / the bitter qualitie excedeth all other qualities / and they haue a foule ſmell or ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge: Pontike Wormwode hath a leſſe leafe and flower / and a better ſmell then the other haue. Therefore Pontike Wormwod differeth from Sea Wormwod in greatnes and in ſtinkinge ſmell: But thys great Wormwode is both greater and more ſtinkinge / and alſo leſſe bindinge then the Sea Wormwode is / then when as Sea Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wode is greater / leſſe bindinge / and more ſtinkinge then Pontike Wormwod / and the common Wormwode excedeth the Sea Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wode in all theſe. It muſt nedes followe that Pontike Wormwode dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth from the common Wormwod / not onelye in the naturall place of growinge / but alſo in bignes / ſmellinge / and bindinge / and the place aboue reherſed / proueth that it is not trewe / that he ſayed that Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike Wormwode is tauler or hygher then the other common Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wodes be / when as Galen teacheth the open contrarye. It is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyl to ſe howe manye ennemies alwayes the trueth hath in all kindes of learninge / after that it hath bene longe hyde / and beginneth to ſpringe vp agayne / and by a fewe is ſet furth to be receyued frelye of all men. Some of the Apothecaries of Rome / belyke warned and taught by ſome learned Phiſician there / began to leaue the common Wormwod that groweth about diches and hyghe wayes wyth the brode leafe and the ſtinkinge ſmell and bitter taſte / and to vſe in the ſtede of that Wormwode that groweth aboue olde walles of Rome. Theſe Apothecaries receyued the trueth and followed it as they were taught.</p>
                  <p>But two Obſeruante freres coulde not abyde the trueth / whiche of late by name wrote agaynſt the Apothecaries of Rome / for holdinge with the trueth. The freres will not aboue the ſmall leaued Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wod / for Pontike Wormwode / becauſe it groweth wythin the wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of the cytye / and alowe the euel fauored ſtinkinge Wormwode that groweth oute of the cytye / becauſe it groweth in a freer ayre then the other doth. In dede if that the broade leaued Wormwode were Pontike Wormwod / as it is not / and ſome of it grewe wythin the cyte / and ſome abrode in the fieldes. It that grewe abroade were the better. But the freres graunt that the ſmall Wormwod that groweth in the cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te / is of a farre other kinde then the common Wormwode is of. Then what compariſon can be made betwene the herbes of two diuerſe kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des / except a man will condemne the one kinde / and ſet oute and alowe the other kinde. The Wormwode that groweth in Rome / is nether Sea Wormwod nor Santonik wormwod / and the deſcription of Pontik Wormwod agreeth with the forme and faſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / qualities and vertues of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18352:12"/> Wormwode that groweth in Rome / therefore it is Pontike wormwode. Loke vpon Galene who ſo liſt in the eleuenth boke <hi>De methodo medendi,</hi> and there he ſhall finde that the deſcription of Pontike wormwode agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the Wormwode of Rome / and that in manye thinges diſagreeth with the comon Worwod / which the freres take for Pontike wormwode. Let then wiſe men iudge whether the right Pontike wormwod growing within the walles of the cyties / ought to be vſed for Wormwod Pontike / or Roman Wormwod / or the euill fauored ſtinkinge kinde that groweth a littel out of the cite / aboute diches and beſyde corne feldes / ought rather to be vſed according vnto the learninge of Galene. The freres bringe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe argumentes / to proue that the Wormwod growing in Rome / is no good Wormwod: one is becauſe by plantinge and chaunginge of groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des / it will not chaunge his qualite / an other is ſett out falſely (as far as I can ſe) or elles manye men lye of Meſue / who (as they ſaye) deſcribeth Wormwod Romane to haue broder leues / ſmooth and playne. What ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of reaſon is this Wormwod growinge in Rome / will not chaunge ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther qualite nor quantite / when he is tranſplanted into a fatter grounde / <hi>ergo</hi> it is naught? Theſe freres if they wold haue taken the paynes to haue rede Theophraſtus <hi>De plantarum cauſis, lib. 1. cap. 1.</hi> diligently / they might haue found there that ſome herbes are worſe for tranſplantinge / and for bringing into a fatter and moyſter grounde. And whether the right Worm<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wod be any of thoſe herbes or no / theſe wordes of Theophraſtus here after folowing / can beare witnes: <hi>Ager agitatus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fectus<expan>

And in the two and thyrtieſt booke / and nynth chapter he deſcribeth it thus. There groweth in the Sea a Wormwod / which ſome call Seriphum / and it is ſmaller then is the Land wormwode. Thys deſcription of Sea wormwode that Plinye hath made here / as farre as I can ſe / is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye vnto the minde and to the open wordes of Galene.

Then when as Plinye maketh Sea wormwode narrower and leſſe then Pontike Wormwod / and not ſo bitter as it is / ether muſt Plinye haue erred / or ellis Galene.

Wherefore I geuinge credit rather vnto Galene then to Plinye / and to myne owne experience / then vnto Plinies here ſaye / do holde that Sea wormwod hath a greater leafe and floure then Pontike Wormwode hath.</p>

It that is black and hard to breake is not commended. The nature of the herbe Aloe is to hele woundes / and the propertie of the iuyce is to drye vp / to prouoke ſlepe / and to make bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes thicke and faſt together / and to louſe the bellye. Two litle ſpounfuls of Aloe beat into pouder / and taken either with cold or with warme water / pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geth the ſtomake / ſtoppeth the vomitinge of blood / and purgeth the iaundes / taken in the quantite of a ſcruple and halfe with water / or a dram in drinke.

Meſue geueth in pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or pilles from a dram and a halfe to two drammes / and in ſtepe or infuſe from a dram and a halfe vnto thre drammes and a halfe.

It ioyneth together agayne the ſkin that couereth the knoppe of boyes yeardes / if it be broken in ſunder with mal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueſey.

It ſtauncheth the head ache / laid vnto the temple and forhead with vinegre and roſe oyle / with

It is good for the ſwellinge in the kyrnelles vnder the tonge for the diſeaſe of the goumes / and all other diſeaſes of the mouth layd to with wyne and honye. Aloe is burnt in a cleane and burninge hote veſſel / and is oft ſtirred with a fether / that it may be all alyke roſted / &amp; ſo it is a good medicine for ſore eyes. Some tyme it is waſhed that the ſand maye go vnto the bottome. Aloe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed is holſomer for the ſtomach / but it purgeth not ſo muche as vnwaſhed.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18352:27"/> The leaues of the herbe are lyke vnto the leaues of a Blyte or the longeſt lea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ues of Baſyle.

The herbe which is named in Dioſcorides Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſon / is alſo called of Galene Amaranthus / and thus it is deſcribed of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſcorides. Heliochriſon hath a litle whyte braunche / grene / ſtreight &amp; ſtronge / and narrowe leaues like vnto Sothernwod / certaine ſpaces goyng betwene the leaues / the top is al yelowe / and is full of rounde knoppes lyke vnto drye berryes / the roote is verye ſmall.

Some lerned men of thys tyme take the herbe called of the Apothecaries Stichas citrina / and of the Germanes Rheinblome / to be Elichriſon. But this herbe hath not leues lyke vnto Sothernwod / but vnto Iſope. Wherefore Stichas citrina is not Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſon of Dioſcorides. The right Elichryſon groweth in Italy / and hath ſo ſmal leaues as Sothernwod hath: and it may be called in Engliſh Floure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour / or yelowe flour amour.

For Plinye geueth the leues of Line / or flackes vnto Antirrhinum / and Dioſcorides deſcribeth hys Antirrhinum with leaues like vnto Pimpernel. His wordes are theſe:
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:18352:35"/> Antirrhinum is an herbe like vnto Pimpernel / both in leues and alſo in ſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke: the floures are purple like vnto Leucoion or viole albe / but leſſe: wherfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re it is called wyld Lichnis / it hath a fruyte like vnto a calfys ſnowt. The herbe / which is deſcribed of Pliny / groweth much in England in the corne feldes / and in fallowed landes: at the fyrſt ſyght it appereth like vnto Cocle in the floure / and partly in the colour of the lefe / which is bygger and longer then flaxe leues be / but not vnlyke them in figure. This herbe maye be called in Engliſh Calfes ſnowte. But Antirrhinum that Dioſcorides deſcribeth / groweth not in England / that euer I ſawe. For it that was ſent me out of Italy / for Antirrhinu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Dioſcoridis / hath not purple floures / but yelow: much lyke vnto the floures of Oſyris. The floures before they open / are like purple in dede but not afterwarde / for then are they fayer yelow / the ſtalke alſo is rounde / and not fourſquared: the buddes out of which the leues come / &amp; the fruite both / do wonderfully nere reſemble a Calfys ſnowte. The leues in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de are lyke vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leues of Pimpernel / but much greater. Therfore as yet I haue ſene no herbe wher vnto the deſcription of Dioſcorides agreeth / nether yet anye that the deſcription of Theophraſt doth agree with. <hi>Amatus Luſita<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nus</hi> writeteth that Antirrhino<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is called in Duche Orant / but Orant / as it is plaine by the deſcription of Tragus is our wele / whiche the diers vſe to dye yelowe with all / but it hath nether the leaues of Pimpernel / nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leues of flax / nor the leaues of Goaſhareth. Wherfore Orant is nether the Antirrhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of Dioſcorides / nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Antirrhinon of Theophraſt / nor it of Pliny / wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for theſe two writers in this herbe deſerue no credit. Matthiolus ſetteth out a kinde of Antirrhinon with ſede (as he ſayth) like vnto a Calfys heade. If he meane by the word ſemen the ſede alone / and not the fruite with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de and all together / and Pliny vnderſtand the word ſemen euen ſo likewiſe / then I thinke that it ſhalbe harde for Matthiolus to finde ſuche one. But if he meane by the word ſemen the fruyte hole as it appeareth outwardlye: then I thinke that the herbe that Matthiolus ſetteth out of all other / dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth nereſt vnto the deſcription of Antirrhinon in Pliny.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Vgwurt is called both of the Grecians and Latines Artemiſia / of the Duche Beyfuſs / or Byfoet. The true Artemiſia is as litle kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen nowe adayes / as is the true Pontyke Wormwode / and leſſe as I thinke: for thys great Mugwurt is ſuche an Artemiſia / as oure Wormwode is Abſinthium Ponticum / that is baſtard / and not the true herbe. Dioſco<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rides writeth / that Artemiſia for the moſte parte groweth about the Sea ſyde / and Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye writeth / that it groweth no where ellis / but in the Sea coaſtes. Thys common Mugwurt of ours / groweth not at anye Sea ſyde that euer I coulde ſe yet: for I coulde neuer ſe it in theſe coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes of England / nor Germanye / nor yet of Italye / but alwayes in hedges / and among the Corne far from the Sea. Artemiſia is a buſſhye herbe / like vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to Wormwode / but it hath greater and fatter leaues and braunches then Wormwood hath. Fyrſt thys great Wormwoode that is common with vs / is not the Wormwod that Dioſcorides compareth Artemiſiam to / but it is Pontike wormwode. But this common Mugwurt is nothinge lyke Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:18352:41"/> wormwode / Therefore this common Mugwurt can not be Artemiſia Dioſcoridis. Galenes Artemiſia is hote in the ſecond degre / and ſklenderlye drye in the ſame. But this common Mugwurte is ſcantlye hote in the fyrſte degre. Wherefore this common Mugwurt can nether be Artemiſia of Dioſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>corides / nor of Galene / nor of Pliny. I found in an Ylande beſide Veniſe / the verye right Artemiſia / whiche had leaues greater then Pontike worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wod a great deale / and fully hote in the ſecond degre / and with floures mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che vnlike vnto wormwode Pontike / but ſomethynge agreynge in ſauour / but not alltogether. Maſter doctor Wendy / the Kinges Phyſiciane can teſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fye of the ſame / whiche dyd examine the herbe with me. This kinde maye be called in Engliſh Sea Mugwurt. Some do take Feuerfewe for one kinde of Artemiſia / and Tanſye for an other kinde / and in dede I thinke not / but that Feuerfewe can do it that is required of Artemiſia. Howebeit / me thinke that the deſcription of Dioſcorides doth not agre in all poyntes wyth Feuer fewe. For Feuerfewe if it were one kinde of Artemiſia / oughte to be lyke in figure and faſhion vnto right Wormwode / and alſo vnto the righte Artemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia / but that it is not. I reporte me vnto them / which haue ſene al the thre her<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bes. Wherefore I dare not pronunce / that Feuerfewe is one of the fyrſt kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of Artemiſia. Dioſcorides maketh alſo mention of another Artemiſia / whiche groweth in the middel lande / and not at the Seaſyde. That ſayth he is a litle herbe with one ſingle or litle ſtalke / and full of floures / of a reade O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renge colour. Thys herbe deſcribeth Dioſcorides to be Sphodra micron / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is verye litle. Nowe when as Tanſye is a great hyghe herbe / how can Tan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſey be this herbe? Me thynke that Feuerfew ſhould be rather thys herbe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Tanſey / if it hadde but one ſtalke / and yelowe floures / as it hath whyte. I thynke therefore / that it is not beſt to pronunce in thys herbe / tyll all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges be better tryed. Matthiolus the Italiane whiche checketh diuerſe by name ſharpelye (in dede ſome worthelye) for their erringe in Artemiſia / er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his owne ſelfe in Artemiſia / in ſettinge that common Mugwurt for the right Artemiſia / which nether agreeth in naturall place / nor in degre of hete nor in likenes w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Dioſcorides deſcribeth / as by places &amp; witneſſes before brought out / I haue ſufficiently already proued: He ſayth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the firſt kindes of Artemiſia are found both in Hetruria / and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they differ in nothinge / ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in faſhion / ſmell / nor taſt / nor vertue / ſauinge onelye in bignes. Whyche ſayinge if it be true / then is the one kinde not it that Dioſcorides deſcribeth / for the leſſe kinde differeth from the bigger in hauing of a ſtinkinge floure. Whether he erreth here or no / let other men iudge. He ſayeth that the two fyrſte kindes growe in Hetruria / as though he knewe them well / but he nether deſcribeth them / nor telleth theyr common names / nor their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall places where they growe / as he doth where he intreateth of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther herbes. Wherefore and for that / that he knoweth not the righte Pontike Wormwode / and erreth in it ſore / it is mooſte lyke that he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth nether of the fyrſte kindes of Artemiſia / and that he erreth as muche in them / as Plinye / Muſa / Fuchſius / and the freres (that write v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Meſue / whom he cheketh for their errours in the kindes of Artemiſia) in theſe &amp; other kindes do.

For the text ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth one kinde of Artemiſia / that groweth commonlye by the Sea ſyde wyth bygge leaues and twigges / and another kinde that is leſſe with a ſmall whyte floure that ſtinketh. And then he maketh mention of an other kind that groweth in the midle land with a litle and ſingle ſtalke. Beſyde theſe thre ſortes he intreateth of an other which is called Artemiſia Lepto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyllos / whereof is mention made in all oure common Greke textes / and common translationes of Dioſcorides / that nowe are / and alſo in the olde translation of Dioſcorides / is mention made at the leſt of thre kindes of Ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>temiſia / although Galene make mention but of two kindes. And where he maketh hys former Artemiſia to be a gardin Herbe / when as Dioſcorides aſſigneth vnto it commonlye the Seaſyde / and Plinye onelye the Sea ſyde: He ſwarueth ones agayne from hys Autor / that he taketh in hande to declare. And to proue againſt Matthiolus / that Matricaria is Artemiſia v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicaulis / he alledgeth diuerſe newe Autores / but withoute name / whome he him ſelfe in diuerſe places of hys booke / condemneth and refuſeth their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torite when it pleaſeth hym / other reaſon bringeth he none in thys place / but that a ſtinkinge herbe lyke Camomile / is Parthenium / and not Matricaria. Therefore Matricaria is Artemiſia Monochlonos. What a pitye argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this is / euerye man maye ſe / for he reaſoneth ſo / as if Mathwed were Parthenium: then there were no other herbe to be Artemiſia vnicaulis / but Matricaria.

But Feuerfewe hath thre or foure / and ſome tyme mo. Therefore it can not be Artemiſia Mochlonos. As for me / becauſe I will not ſeme better learned then I am / I knowe but one true kinde of Artemiſia / as for the common Mugwurte. I thynke a man maye vſe it in Phyſike vntill a better kinde maye be founde / whiche thinge I truſte ſhall ſhortelye come to paſſe in manye places / if Phyſicianes will take the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to go forewarde in ſekinge out of Herbes as they haue begon.</p>

Euerye leafe commeth furth alone of litle braunches / ſomthinge readiſhe / and hath but one litle foot ſtalke as Yuy hath. It hath white iuice / but not muche / it hath a ſaltiſhe taſte / and ſomethinge bitter / with a fat growinge together. The hole herbe is euell for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtomache / ſharpe or bitinge / and it louſeth the belly excedingly ſodden wyth meate: and for the great ſharpnes it is ſodden with fat meat. Although I haue theſe xvj. yeares ſought for the right Braſſica marina / and haue founde one herbe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the common ſorte of learned men take for it / And another which I thought alone y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it had bene the right Braſſica marina / yet when I conſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and wey both the herbes w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the deſcription of Dioſcorides / I find nether of both agreynge with the hole deſcription. The herbe which I toke for braſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſica marina / groweth within the floodmarke of the Sea / and commonly at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bankes of crekes that rin throw middowes or grene grounde / and in ſtonye Ilandes / wherevnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaltwater commeth to at certayne tymes in the year / as at great ſpringe tydes and tempeſtes. I haue ſene it in Eaſt Freſeland a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Norden / where as it is called Leppelkruyt / of the likenes that it hath with a ſpoune. I haue ſene it in England at Weſtcheſter / at Portlande / and at Porbeke / but I could neuer learne anye name of it / but Scurby wede / or Scurby wurt / it maye alſo well be called Spounwurte. When it commeth fyrſt furth / it hath fyue or ſixe / ſomtime mo / and ſometyme fewer leaues alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether / ſtanding right vp after the maner of Pirola / or of a yonge Bete / the foote ſtalke is longe and towarde the ground rediſhe / the leues are fat thick and round / not vnlike to Aſarabacca or Folfoote / but that they are leſſe and grener. They are ſomthinge ſaltiſh &amp; bitter / and very hote and ſharpe in taſt / and haue a certayne ſmake of cole / which is vnpleaſant by the reaſon of the heate &amp; bitternes that is ioyned wyth it. It hath a ſtalke almoſt a ſpan long / and the leaues that growe vpon the ſtalke / are much longer and more ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per pointed then they that come ſtreight waye firſt from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> roote. The floure
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18352:55"/> is whyte / and the ſede is dunniſh blacke. The people of the countre vſe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſcurbuke or crippel euel. I haue proued that it is not only good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that diſeaſe / but alſo againſt the dropſey / as the noble clerke Reinerus the Rector of the ſcole of Gruninge / and Henrike Herbart can bere witnes. Yet for all thys I dare not giue ſentence that it is the right Braſſica marina of Dioſcorides / namely becauſe a great deale of it purgeth but a litle / when as the true Braſſica marina of Dioſcorides purgeth very ſore / and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at no ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me that I ſawe it / any milke or whyt iuice did appere in it. The herbe which is commonlye taken in Italy / Fraunce and Germany / for Braſſica marina / is called of the Herbaries Soldana or Soldanella. But it that Matthiolus ſetteth out / is not the ſame herbe / namelye in the roote / that oure Soldanel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la is / which groweth in England and Flandres / nether it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is ſold at Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford and at Anwerp. For as the reſt of the hole herbe is like vnto wythwinde or wedebind / called of ſome Volubilis / of other Helxine ciſampelos / in al thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges / ſauinge that the leaues are rounder and not ſo ſharpe / ſo is the roote al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo lyke vnto the roote of the ſame herbe. Oure Soldanella a far of loketh like a Mallowe / both in the floures and leaues / but when a man commeth nere vnto it / it loketh ſo lyke a Withwinde / that a man wold ſaye / that it were no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing ellis / but a Sea withwinde / The floures are in all pointes lyke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with windes floures / that is of the faſhion of a bell / ſauing that they are greater and purpliſh blewe. And when as all the reſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> herbe crepeth vpon the Sea ſande / the floures ſtand gallantly right vp / and ſhewe meruelous well vpon the plaine ſand or grauell. The ſede is lyke the ſede of other win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des / blackiſh and round / as great as a fitche / and ſomethinge greater. The leaues are as rounde as the leaues of Ariſtolochia the rounde / and Aſarabac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ca are. The taſt is not ſo ſharpe as the taſt of the leaues of Spounwurte are. They purge beten into pouder in the quantite of two drammes / but nothing ſo much as Dioſcorides ſemeth to meane that braſſica marina doth. For Dioſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>corides ſayth <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. The hole herbe is ſharpe or bytinge / and ſome for the ſharpenes ſeth it wyth fat fleſhe. Then when as Soldanella hath no longe leaues / but all round / &amp; is nether ſo ſharpe nor ſo vehemente a purger / as Dioſcorides maketh hys braſſicam marinam to be: nether hath anye qualitie / nether in taſt nor ſmell / wherefore it ſhould be called braſſica marina / and ſeynge the hole herbe is ſo lyke vnto Helxine ciſampelo / and to ſmilaci ſylueſtri / and compared it to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of them. A man may dout whether Soldanella be Braſſica marina Dioſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corides or no.

Then when as the third calamint muſt haue lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger leaues then wild mint: That herbe that hath longer leues then the wild mint / called Mentaſtrum / is not lyke the thirde Calamint.

If the increaſe of the leafe then make Mentaſtrum lyke a Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel / then the thyrd Calaminte / which muſt nedes be longer leaued then Men<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taſtrum is / maye well be like a nettel / as touching the length of the leafe. An other cauſe is / ſayeth Matthiolus / why that the opinion of Ruellius oughte to be refuſed and whiſteled oute / is becauſe he hath ſene the right third Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamint

I found the ſame herb of late beſide the Ile Porbeck. But when as Dioſcorides ſemeth to make one Cepeam / and Pliny an other / there muſt be two kindes of Cepea. As for it of Pliny / I haue ſpoken of it before: but as touching the Cepea of Dioſcori<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des / I haue thoughte that a certaine kinde of ſmall broocklyme was Cepea / but afterwardes I ſawe in Freſeland in watery places / and oft in poules y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were ful in winter and dryed vp in ſummer an herbe / which loked much liker vnto porcellaine / then brooklyme doth. It had leues like porcelain / but much leſſe. I dout which of theſe two I ſhould take for the right Cepea. Fuchſius which taketh brooklyme but not truely / for Sio / in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende of the chapter of Sion ſaith / that the herbe is vſed this day of horſeleches to ſwage ſwellings and to heale ſcabbes of farcies of horſes. Tragus hath theſame meaning and telleth alſo / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if it be fryed with butter and vinegre / and ofte layd to / and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of &amp; renued agayne / that it healeth not only any ſwelling / but alſo ſainte Antonies fyre / or ſuch inflammationes. I haue proued it my ſelfe by experien<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce / that brooklyme is very good for a deceaſe that reigneth much in Freſela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d called the Scourbuch. I ſod the herbe in butter milke / the cheſe and butter ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken away / and gaue the pacientes it ſo / I made them eate it diuerſe wayes / whereby they were within a ſhorte tyme healed. But I neuer proued as yet / what vertue the other herbe that groweth in poules hath. Matthiolus ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth oute in dede an herbe not vnlike vnto porcelline / but he nether telleth where it groweth / nether what colour it hath / nether what taſte nor ſmell it hath / nether what vertue it hath / nether what the Potecaries name it / ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the comon people. Wherfore no man can learne of him how to find it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine / except a man wil go to the Phiſiciane which ſente him the herbe. For the figure of an herbe maketh it not alone / but the qualities alſo that belonge thereto. As with diuerſe other learned Phiſicianes / Matthiolus refuſeth her<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bes hauing a conuenient figure / yet for lack of the vertues and qualitees y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> herbe ſhould haue with the figures / and will not ſuffer them to be taken for the herbes which other of lighter iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be only for the figure and faſhions ſake. Wherfore I had leuer take Brooklime for Cepea / though it be not ſo like porceline as other be / becauſe it is tried to heale ſcabbes as ce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pea of Dioſcorides doth. Amatus Luſitanus who taketh in hand to declare Dioſcorides / beyng belyke more cunning in the Duche tonge / then in his ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne / or ellis hauinge more helpe of the Duche writers / then of the Spanyards or Italians / giueth to Cepea nether any Spaniſh / nether Italian name / but a Duch name / and he calleth it in Duche wild purtzel. But wild purtzel as Tragus a duch writer of herbes ſaith / differeth nothing from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gardin porce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain / but that it hath leſſe leaues and floures / and rinneth and ſpedeth it ſelfe vpon the ground / when as the gardin porcelaine hath broader leaues &amp; gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth righter vp. This wild purtzel did I finde thiſſame yeare in the montai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Wiſſenburgh / a litle fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a vineyard / &amp; I am ſure y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was a righte kind of porcelaine. Then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as Cepea is not in Dioſcorides a kind of porcellain / but is only lyke porcellaine / Amatus giueth a wronge Duch name to Cepea.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:18352:71"/> Wherefore let not the Duche men gyue any credit vnto him in this matter: The ſame maketh Telephium wild porcellaine / &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third kinde of ſedi wilde porcellain / and Cepeam wild porcellaine. It is maruel that he that hath bene in ſo manye landes / and profeſſeth to teache ſo manye names / in ſo many ton<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges can finde for thre diuerſe herbes all differing in name one from an other / but one name which is in Latin Portula ſylueſtris / which is named in duch Wild purtzel. And in his enarration of Cepea / which is the 165. he ſheweth no more but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this herbe groweth chefely about the ſandye ſea ſhores / where as the wild purtzel of the duche men groweth not as Fuchſius and Tragus in their Herballes beare witnes.

But the blacke Ciche is a good medicine againſte venome and poyſone / and moſt of al / prouoketh vrine / and breaketh the ſtones of the kidneys and blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der / the whiche thing no other pulſe can do ſo wel / and ſpeciallye the black &amp; litle one / and that thinge doth the broth of them more mightelye / the whiche pulſe for all that aboue al other pulſes hurte the ſores and exulcerations. But the red Ciche is hoter then the whyte / and ingendreth groſſe humores. Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſteped in water a night / and then taken / kille wormes in the bellye. But he that hath taken them / let him faſte ſixe houres after. The broth of Ciches is good for the iaundies / if black Ciche be ſodden with radiſhe and parſelye / and the broth be taken with Almonde oyle / it purgeth effectuallye and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth oute the ſtones of the kidnes and bladder.

I deſyre no other witneſſes againſt him / but his owne figures of theſe fore written herbes / whereof neuer one is lyke vnto the comon hellebore / for it hath leues lyke vnto hemp / or Agnus / &amp; not to theſe.

For Dioſcorides compareth the leafe of Agnus to an Oliue leafe / and the leafe of Hempe vnto the leafe of an Aſhe tree / which he wolde not haue done / if al the fyue or ſeuen longe thinges had made but one leafe. The leaues of the common Hellebor come eleuen / or there about all furth of one common foote ſtalke. Wherefore there are ſo manye leaues / for they are not ioyned together at the botom / nether come oute of one pece of leafe / or thinge lyke a palme of a mannis hande. Alſo theſe leaues of common Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor ſeuerally taken / are nothinge lyke a Playne tre leaues / nor the leaues of ſphondylij / nether al the leaues taken together / are lyke vnto the leaues of a Plain tre / nor of ſphondylij / for they are deuided one from an other / when as the longe thinges lyke fingers in the Plain tre leafe are not deuided awaye from the portion of the leafe / out of the which they come / if the leaues of the common Hellebore leaues had bene ioyned / as I haue aboue reherſed in the bottom / to one portion of the leafe / lyke as it were the palme of an hande / then I would haue ſayd that they had bene lyke to the leaues of the Plaine tree and of Sphondylij. But ſeynge they are not / I conclude that they are nether lyke vnto the Plain tree leues / nor to the leaues of Sphondilij / and therefore that the common black Hellebor is not the black Hellebore of Dioſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>corides. Then when as the common Hellebor hath the vertues of Conſiligo / and no other herbe is knowen to haue the lyke / ſauinge true Helleborus / and Helleborus is not Conſiligo / and this common Hellebor is not Helleborus ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger / it is no vayne gatheringe / that this herbe commonly called Helleborus niger / is Conſiligo.</p>

A good big grane is inough for a chylde / for if it be taken in anye greater quantite / it is ieperdous. It driueth out fleme both vpwarde and dounewarde. It is a good purgation for them that are ſhortwinded. If ye wil purge the bellye / put twyſe as much ſalt and as much ſtibium as wil coloure it / and gyue a pyll in the quantite of a litle peſe. And afterward drinke an vnce and fyue drames of warme water: But to prouoke vomite / take the water that Elaterium is ſteped in / and ſtroke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inwarde parte of the tonge beneth with a fether / which is dipped in the ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinge.

Elaterium helpeth weomen vnto theyr ſicknes / if it be put in the place of conception in a ſuppoſitorie. It healeth the iaundies or guelſought / if it be poured into the noſe with milke. It is verye good agaynſt olde head akes. It is verye excellent good for the quinſey / if it be layd to with olde oyle and honye / or the gall of a bul.

The iuyce of the hole herbe war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and preſſed / and dronken with a litle honye and ſaltpeter / doth gentlye loſe the bellye. If anye man make hollowe a rawe gourd / and will put wine into it / and ſet it abroad vnder the ſkye out of the houſe / and then drinke it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting / it wil louſe the bellye gently. The Gourde (ſayth Galene) is of a colde and moyſte complexion / and is moyſte and colde in the ſeconde degre. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the iuyce of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> braunches is good for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> payne of the eares / whiche is w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> an inflammation / if it be layd to with roſe oyle. And ſo if it be hole layd to / it coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth metely well hote inflammations. When as it is eaten it is moyſte and dri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth thryſt away. The Gourde whilſe it is rawe / is vnpleaſant and hurteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtomake / and is very harde of digeſtion in ſo muche that if a man for lacke of other meate be fayne to eate a gourde (as one preſumed to do) he ſhall fele an

Furthermore it is not harde to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted / if it be not corrupted before. And that chaunſeth vnto it when it is noughtely dreſſed or any euell humor is gathered in the ſtomake / and ſomty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me becauſe it taryeth to long in the ſtomach / which thinge chaunceth vnto al other vndurable fruytes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are of a moyſt complexion / for they putrefy quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye in the ſtomake / except they come fyrſt vnto the bottom of it. Therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as the gourde as much as is in it / hath a iuyce that can not be diſcerned by any ſence what qualitie it is of / and is eaſy to be diſtribute into the hole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy / ſo when as it is mingled with anye other thing that hath any great nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble qualite / it is made lyke it very eaſely / as if it be taken with muſtarde / the iuyce which commeth of theſe two mixed and diuided / and ſent into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye / ſhal be ſharpe or byting with a notable heate. Euen by the ſame reaſon if it be eaten with anye ſalt thinge / it will ingendre in the bodye a ſalt humore. And ſo is it a verye pleaſant meat if it be dreſſed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſalt fiſhes of pontus / which are called in Greke mela. But if it be ſodden and ſeaſoned as it ought to be with quinces / it wil haue an excellent tarte taſte in the diſtribution. If it be fryed or roſted / it putteth a greate deale awaye of his owne moyſture. Therefore becauſe it is ſo moyſte if ye will boyle it / it is beſt to boyle organ or wild mergerum with it. For al ſuche as thys fruyte is / had nede to be mixed with other thinges that are byting / or ſower / or tarte / or ſalt / if ye wold haue them delectable in eatinge / &amp; not to make one to be redy to vomite. Simeon Sethy ſayth that the gourde prouoketh vrine / and maketh a man go to the ſtole / and it is good for hote and drye complexions. It ſtancheth the burning heate of the ſtomache and liuer. It hurteth them that are flegmatike and wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teriſhe / and it is euel for the colyke. And if it finde euel humores in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtomach / it is corrupted therewith / and is made holſom noriſhment.

The firſte kind that Pliny deſcribeth / might ſeme to be our comon dragon / if that the leaues of oure dragon were not ſmaller / then the leaues of a Bete / wherevnto Pliny compareth the firſt kinde of Dracontion / but Pliny ſayth that the firſte kinde is lyke vnto Aron / for whiles the dragon is yet yonge / the leaue of it is verye lyke vnto the lefe of Aron. Dioſcorides alſo maketh Dragon lyke vnto Aron in the deſcription of Aron. Galene alſo writeth that Dragon is lyke Aron / both in lefe and roote / wherfore I doute not but that our common dragon is the true dragon. Howebeit when the ſtalke is greate and redy / within a ſhorte whyle to bring furth the floure and fruyte: the lefe that is in the top of the ſtalke / goeth awaye from the firſte lykenes / and hath manye leaues together / but al ioyned together in one lefe / and not cumming furth of diuerſe ſtalkes or braunches.

But I haue not ſene it in England: and therefore I knowe no common Engliſh name of it. Howbeit / it maye be called in Engliſhe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dragon. Dioſcorides deſcribeth his Dragon thus: Dragon hath a leafe lyke Iuy great and notable with whyte ſpottes / and a ſtreyght ſtalke / two cubites long of diuers coloures / ſprinkled with diuerſe purple ſpottes / ſo that it doth reſemble a ſerpent very nere / it is as thick as a ſtaf.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>ABA is called in Greke kyamos / &amp; theſe manye yeares we haue engliſhed Faba a Bean in En<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gliſh as the Duche haue named it ein Bonen in their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che / from whence our ſpech came. But firſt a certein Duch man of late named Hieronymus Tragus / after w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> diuerſe reaſons and autorities goeth about to proue that faba called kyamos of the Grecianes / is not the pulſe that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Duche bonen. His reaſones are theſe: The firſt is that where as Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſt and Plinye write / that the faba or kyamos cometh not out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground before xv. dayes / that the comon beane appereth in Germany in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> v. or vj. daye An other reaſon is / that where as Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny writeth / that al other pulſes ſauing the Faba / hath but one roote / wher as Pliny ſemeth to gyue mo then one to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faba. The third argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is alſo ſet out of Pliny / whiche ſaith that faba are ſo fruytful / that one ſtalke hath bene laden with an hundreth fabis: but ther is no ſuch plenty in the Duch bonen: therefore the Duche bonen can not be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba. He fetched an other argument out of Galene the xj. boke of Simple medi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cines / Galene ſaith there that oniſkos / which are called in Latin millipedes / (and in Engliſhe are named Horſe lice or Hobtruſhes lice) are round beſtes / when as they draw themſelues into a round figure like a boule or balle / ſom with vs call them kyamous / becauſe they are lyke vnto fabis: after that they haue drawen them ſelues in to the round figure of a boul or a balle / or ſuche a round thing. But the common bean is not round like a boule / therefore the comon bean can not be kyamos or faba. And this argument he confirmeth by the autorite of Dioſcorides / who in the chapter of Iuniper (as he alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth Dioſcorides) maketh one kind of Iuniper berries like a faba / but they are round / therefore the faba ought alſo to be round. Theſe &amp; certeine other ſuch argumentes doth Tragus bringe furth to proue that the Duch bonen / which is al one with our beane / is not the Latines faba / and the Grecianes kyamos. Now when as Dioſcorides deſcribeth not fabam / where as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth of the nature of it / of a purpoſe it is mete that we fetch out of other places of Dioſcorides / and out of other autores / ſo much as we can that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth vnto the deſcription of Faba. Dioſcorides intreating of Climenon / ſayth that it hath a fourſquared ſtalke like to the ſtalke of faba. Theophraſte lib. 7. cap. 3. writeth that the ſtalke of kyamos or faba is hollow within / and that it groweth right vp. Plinye ſayth alſo that of pulſes onely the faba with
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:18352:119"/> lupines hath but one ſtalk. Theſame Theophraſt ſaith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it hath a round lefe / as Pliny doth alſo. Pliny ſaith that in the floure are certeine letters of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or weping / which is nothing but a black or brouniſh ſpot that is in the floure / Theophraſt ſaith that the ſkin of the beane is verye thicke.</p>
                  <p>Dioſcorides maketh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſede of Xiris like vnto the ſede of faba or kyamos / &amp; Galene in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> boke <hi>de alimentis</hi> maketh round the kyamos of faba / <hi>non nititur numeroſa radice</hi> / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is faba leneth not vpon many rootes / ſayth Theophraſte contrary vnto Pliny / whiche wold y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the faba onlye ſhould amongeſt pulſes haue many rootes. Theophraſtes wordes in Greke are theſe: <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, that is / it is weike and empty / &amp; hath not many rootes. Theophraſt compareth the fruit of Lotus vnto fabe. Nowe let vs ſe in how many poyntes our comon beane doth agre with the aboue named markes / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tores gyue vnto fabe. Our beane hath one rote as faba hath / ſingle &amp; but one. Our beane hath a ſtreight fourſquared and hollow ſtalke / &amp; as faba hath the leues round / and the floure haue ſpottes as Pliny writeth / that the faba hath in them: But in the figure and forme of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſede / our beane agreeth not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the beane y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Galene in diuerſe places writeth of / for where as it is round / oure is long and ſomthinge flat. If I coulde anſwere vnto this point / the reaſones y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Tragus &amp; other bring / were ſonne anſwered to.

Well if our beane be not the faba of old writers / I wold ſom body wold ſhewe vs what pulſe is there ether in Italy or Spaine / England or Almany / or Franch / which is the olde writers Faba. Hieronymus Tragus taketh the herbe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is in dede Cicercula / but vnknowen to him to be <hi>faba antiquorum.</hi> But Cicercula becauſe it is not rounde / &amp; groweth not right vp / but aſyde / can not be faba: Cicercula hath al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo long leues / when as the beane by the autoritie of the ſame Theophraſt are ſingle / therefore it can not be <hi>faba antiquorum.</hi> Amatus Luſitanus as he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth him ſelfe / and Rembert Holpen with the reaſon of Tragus / deny y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our beane is the <hi>faba antiquorum</hi> / but they telle not what pulſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is in this parte of Europa. And ſo they take fabam away from vs / but they ſet nothing in the ſtede of it / as Tragus more boldelye then lernedly did. Two of theſame men hold y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our comon bean is faſelus. But y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our comon beane can not be faſelus / firſt I wil proue by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wordes of Rembert / which ſaith both in his duche and Frenche herbal / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> faſelus is phaſiolus of Dioſcorides / but Faſeolus can not grow vp w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out ſtakes or poules / &amp; the beane can / therfofe the beane is not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelus.

                  <p>The larche tree co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menly is lower then the fyrre tree / but in ſom places it is fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de as hyghe as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firre tree is. The loweſt parte of the boli or body of the larche tree / next vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de / hath a barke very harde / and it is full of ryftes &amp; gapynges / whiche appeare lyke certayn depe furrowes. If ye hew it / and cut it / with an hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet / ye ſhall fynde it very rede / and vntill ye come vnto the bunghes it is roughe / but after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye come to the pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce where the bowes grow / then it is ſmother &amp; in color / is out of an aſſhy whytiſhe. The bunghes are leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any other kynde conenutberyng tre hath / and they are tougher and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re bowyng / and theyr color is out of yelow rediſhe / and of a very pleaſant ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor. The leaues are blunt / ſoft and bowyng / two fingers long / a litle brode / &amp; of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bygnes of fenel leaues. About thyrty grow together about one knop / after the maner of a beame. In taſte they are not ſo byndyng as other lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues of trees of lyke kynde be. In ſmell they reſemble y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaues of a pyne tre. The larche tre is very lyke vnto the cypres tre / in the fruite or nutt. For the larch nut is as greate as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cypres nut is / and ſomthinge longer / and hath a ſhorte ſtele or foot ſtalk / wherby the fruite is ioyned vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tree.

Thys tree groweth largely in the mountayes in the land of Cour / and in the alpes that are betwene Itali and the countre called Rhetia / where of one parte is in the dioceſe of Cour.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:18352:152"/> the larche tree will take no flame / and that it will no more burn the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſtone. Amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt many old wryters that hold opinion / I will bryng furth but two to beare witnes of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mater. The one is Palladius / which writeth thus in hys boke of huſbandry of the Larche tre. Larix ſayeth he / is very profitable to make bordes of / &amp; to lay them vnder the tyles / in the vtter parte of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe. If thou do ſo / thou haſt made a ſure defence againſt al burning: For tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe bordes will nether receyue any flame / nether will they make any cole. The other olde writer is named Vitruuius / who in hys ſecond booke of byl<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding wryteth theſe wordes of the larche tree. The larche trees / ſaieth he / are touching the leaues / like vnto the pyne tree leaues. The tymbre is long &amp; as tractable for any inwarde werck as Sapin is. And it hath moyſte or liquide roſin of the color of the hony of Athenes. And it is good for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that haue the tiſick in theyr lunges. The Larche tre whiche is not knowen / but only vnto the proper inhabitantes / that ether dwel about the banck of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus flood / and about the ſee ſhores of the Venetiane ſee / not only is not hur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted / w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> rottyng or muldring / or wyth wormes / by the meanes of the great bitternes that it hath / but alſo it will receyue no flame of the fire. Nether can it burn any otherwyſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſtone doth in a lyme kyll. Yet by other wod it burneth. And yet not euen then doth it receyue the flame / nether gyueth any cole / but in a long tyme it is ſlowly burnt. And thys is the cauſe / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is in it a ſmall temperature of the principales of the ayer and fyre. For the wod beynge thick and hard faſtened together / with an earthly moyſture / and not hauyng voyd ſpaces for holes / by the whyche the fyre may entr in: it putteth back the pour of the fyre / and ſuffereth not it ſelfe to be hurt of the reaſon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heuynes / it is not holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water / but when it is born ether in ſhyppes / or is ſet aboue the fyrr raft: How that this tymbre was founde / there is a cauſe to know it. The renowmed and noble Ceſar / when he had an hoſte about the alpes / he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inhabitantes there that were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hym / to finde vitales. But there was a faſt toun / named Laringum / and the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the town truſtyng to theyr naturall defence / would not obey the commandement of Ceſar. Therfore the chefe capitayne commaunded y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gariſones to beſedge it. But there was before the gate of the towne / a tour made of thys tymbre / made of diuerſe beames / one goyng croſſe ouer an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And it was very hygh / and in faſſhon after the making of a broche or a ſteple / that is great beneth and ſmall aboue / ſo that a man myght put back agyn them that came vp / both wyth ſtones and clubbes. But when it was perceyued that they had no other wepenes but ſtones &amp; clubbes / and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they could not caſt far from the wall / by the reaſone of the heuynes / the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment was geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> faggoters made of ſmall bruſſhe / ſhuld be ſet a fyre / and layd to the holde. The ſouldyers dyd that ſpedely. But as ſoun as the flame had taken holde of the faggottes / beſyde the tymbre / and went vp in to the ayre a loft / it made all menn thynck that all the hole heap ſhuld fall by and by. But when the flame went out of it ſelf / and ſo was que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ched / and the tour appered vntouched / Ceſar woundering greatly / comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould be compaſſed round about / with out the caſtyng of dartes. But when the townes men compelled by fere / had geuen vp and yelded them ſelues / it was demanded of them from whence the wodde came / which woulde not be hurt w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyre.

But hys reaſones that he bryngeth to proue hys purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe wyth al: are not ſo ſtronge / but that they may be confuted. Hys firſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is thys. Both Dioſcorides and Pliny make Cyprum a ſtrange tree / and aſſigne to it far and ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres to grow in / as in Canope / in Aſca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lone / and in Egypt. But Liguſtrum groweth euery where / therefore Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtrum is not Cypros. Firſt Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius ſayeth not truely in ſayng that Dioſcorides and Pliny make Cypros a ſtrange tre / if he meane by ſayng ſo that they meant / that it grew not in theyr countrees. For allthough Dioſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corides ſayeth that the beſt Cypros groweth in Canope / and in Aſcalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne: yet it foloweth not / that Dioſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides denyeth that there is any Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pros growyng in Grecia or in Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The ſame Dioſcorides wryteth that the beſt Iris groweth in Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co and in Macedonia: doth it folow therefore that he ſayeth that Iris gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth nowhere els but in Illyrico and in Macedonia. Thys firſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therefore as ye ſe / is of no effect. And where as he ſayeth / that Pliny maketh Cyprum a ſtrange or foren tre / which groweth not in Italy: he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth not truely of Pliny / for Plinies wordes of Cypros are theſe: <hi>Ligu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum eadem arbor eſt quae in oriente Cypros.</hi> Liguſtrum is the ſame tre that Cy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pros is in the Eaſt. How ſhal a man then gather that Pliny ſayeth / that there is no Cypros in Italy / when as he ſayeth thus playnly as ye haue hearde that Liguſtrum is the ſame tre that Cypros is in the Eaſte / then if Liguſtrum and Cypros be all one as he ſayeth: then / when as Liguſtrum groweth in Italy / then groweth alſo there Cypros. But Maſſarius expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth theſe wordes: Liguſtrum is the ſame tre that is Cyprus in the Eaſte / after thys maner: Ye muſt vnderſtand that where Pliny ſayeth the ſame: that thys worde the ſame / is as muche to ſay as the ſame in lyknes. For if he would that Cypros ſhould haue bene Liguſtrum / he would not haue ſayde in the xij. booke / Cypros is a tre in Egypt wyth leaues of iuiuba / when as Liguſtrum groweth euery where in Italy. Nether doth he hold in that place / that Cypros is Liguſtrum / where he ſayeth: <hi>Quidam dicunt Cy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>prum eſſe arborem, quae in Italia Liguſtrum vocatur.</hi> Some ſay that Cyprus is the tre whiche is called in Italy Liguſtrum. Theſe be hys argumentes where
<pb facs="tcp:18352:161"/> with he would haue proued that Cypros and Liguſtrum were not all one. But to anſwer vnto to hys reaſones / I axe of hym or any other that hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth hys opinion / where or in what place Theophraſte / Dioſcorides or Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny / or any other good writers of herbes / vſed any ſuch phraſe or maner of ſpeakyng as thys. The lefe of Berony is an oke lefe / or the lefe of veruyn is an oke lefe / becauſe the oke leaues are lyke vnto the leaues of veruyn and betony. Who dyd euer ſay that an ape was a man / becauſe he is lyke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a man? ſurely that I remembre / I haue not red any ſuche phraſe in Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nether in any other good autor. But what if thys where a ryfe phraſe in Pliny / yet for all that / it ſhould not folow in this place that eadem / ſhould betoken lyke. And that ſhall I proue by thys reaſone. Ye grant that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtrum is very lyke Cypros / and ſo lyke that the one may be named wyth the others names / becauſe they be ſo lyke. Then if Liguſtrum haue alſo the properties of Cyprus as it hath. The perfit lykewiſe / where in differeth the one from the other / when as they agre in all poyntes both in lyknes and in vertues. But Pliny gyueth the ſame vertues vnto Liguſtro that Dioſcori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des gyueth vnto Cypro: rede the places in the forſayde autores / and ye ſhal fynde that I ſay true. Wherefore ſeyng that Liguſtrum is Cypros both in lyknes and in vertue / the interpretation of Maſſarius is not to be alowed. And as for the meanyng of theſe wordes of Pliny / Liguſtrum is the ſame tre that Cypros is in the Eaſte / it hath hys profites / vſes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modites in Europa etc. Me thynke / that thys is the ryght vnderſtandyng of them. The tre that is called in the Eaſte Cypros / is called Liguſtrum in Italy. But allthough Cypros in the Eaſt be much ſtronger in operation / yet our Liguſtrum is not alltogether without vertue in Italy / for it hath theſe vertues folowyngs / whiche in dede Dioſcorides as I ſayd before / ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vnto Cypro. But yet I muſt anſwer to an other reaſon that Maſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us maketh / which is thys: If Pliny had meant that Cypros had bene Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtrum / then wold he not haue ſayde in the xij. booke / Cypros is a tre in Egypt / when as Liguſtrum groweth euery where in Italy. Tho whome I anſwere / by thys queſtion / in what book writeth Pliny that Liguſtrum is Cypros: Writeth he not ſo in the xxiij. booke? Thys ones graunted that Cypros is Liguſtrum / and that Liguſtrum groweth in Italy / I trow when as Pliny holdeth both theſe ſentences / that he gathereth not truely of Pliny that he ſhould mean that Cypros were not to be found in Italy. Pliny in the ſam place where he ſayeth that Cypros is a tre in Egypt / he ſayeth alſo: <hi>Quidam hanc eſſe dicunt arborem quae in Italia Liguſtrum vocetur.</hi> Some ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thys is the tre which is called in Italy Liguſtrum. Then when as to ſaye that Cypros is in Egypt / is not to deny that it is in Italy and to alledge that ſom men ſay that Cypros is the tre which is called in Italy Liguſtrum / is much leſſe to deny that Liguſtrum is in Italy: thys reaſone of Maſſarius is found to be as weke as hys former argumentes be. If that any aſke of me how chanceth that Pliny ſemeth to dout in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> xij. booke wheter Cypros be Liguſtrum or no / and that in the xxiij. he pronunceth and gyueth ſentence of it that he ſemeth to dout of before. I anſwer that Pliny when as he wrote the xij. booke / douted wheter Cypros was Liguſtrum or no / ether becauſe he had heard it ſo to be ether of ſom vncertayn reporte / or had red it in ſom autor / whoſe autorite deſerued not full credit / and that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18352:161" rendition="simple:additions"/> when he wrote a good ſeaſon afterwarde the xxiij. booke / he had in the mean tyme learned of credible and learned men / or red in credit worthy au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores / that Cypros was Liguſtru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Betwene the twelft booke and the xxiij. ten bookes are conteyned / and ſome one booke conteyned in printe ix. large ſhetes of papyr: What tyme will a reſonable man gyue vnto Pliny for the ſtudying ſettyng in order / and wrytyng of theſe x. bookes: If ye grant hym a moneth for euery booke to perfit it / as ye can grant hym no leſſe: ſeyng that he was the admirall or chefe rueler of the Emperoures Naui / and ſo cumbred with many weighty beſineſſes which belonged vnto hys office / ye muſt grant that in the ſpace of x. monethes Pliny myght not only ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue learned the certaynte of Cypros / but of many other thynges where of he was vncertayn before. Therfore thys ought to trouble no man that Pliny in hys later booke doth hold boldly / it where of in hys former booke / he was doutfull. The other reaſones of Maſſarius I paſſe ouer as ſo weik that euen the yong ſtudentes of Phyſick are able inoughe to confut by them ſelues.

                     <p>But if the patient cannot be eaſely waked again / it is mete to vſe ſuch other comen remedies. Auicenna wold that they that are hurt with thys herbe / ſhould vomit with hony and butter. Where as Dioſcorides wolde that a mans heade ſhould haue Roſe oile &amp; vinegre poured vpon it / when a man hath taken to muche of Mandrag. Matthiolus ſayeth that it is agaynſt reaſon that it ſhuld be layd to the heade which is colde / when as the cauſe of the diſeaſes alſo colde / and to take to bores in one wod / he catcheth Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene and accuſeth hym for a lyke faute / that is for conſelyng men to pour ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe oyl and vinegre vpon them that haue the drawſy or forgetfull euel. And to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fute Galene / he alledgeth Aetius / Paulus / and Trallianus / which do not admit oyl &amp; vinegre alone / but woulde hoter medicines as erthpyne wilde tyme / penin all / caſtorium / and ſuche lyke to be put ther to. As for Ga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lene I leue hym vndefended at thys tyme vntill I ſhall haue more leaſure / but for Dioſcorides I anſwer / that if iij. later writers then Galene / were inough to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fute hym: as many myght by good reaſon be ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to defend Dioſcorides from that faut that Matthiolus layeth vnto Dioſcoridiſſes charge. But ij. of the witneſſes that he allegeth to confute Galene with all / that is Aetius and Paulus / &amp; with them a learned laterwryter of the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cianes Actuarius / counſel that roſe oyle with vinegre ſhould be poured vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hedes of them that haue eaten or dronken to much of Mandrag. But Matthiolus a lytle after in the ſame chapter forgettyng what he had accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Dioſcorides / and Galene of before / wryteth theſe wordes folowynge: <hi>Tametſi Mandragorae poma matura, &amp;c.</hi> Allthoughe the rype apples of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drag the ſedes taken out / be eaten diuerſe tymes with out any grefe at all: Yet the vnrype apples eaten with theyr ſede / bryng dedely withfalles. There ryſeth after vnſufferable heate / which burneth all the outer parte of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18352:170"/> the ſkinne. The toung and the mouthe withere and waxet drye / wherefore they that are ſo vexed / are ſene allwayes gapyng with theyr mouthe / and drawyng in colde ayre. Thus farr Matthiolus. Now ſeyng that he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth openly here that men are in ſuche heat as haue eaten of the vnrype ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which are muche colder then the rype apples be: how iuſtly was Dioſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corides accuſed a litle before for counſellyng roſeoyle and vinegre / becauſe they were colde / to be poured vpon the heades of them that had taken to muche Mandrag? And how well doth thys hys ſayng of the hote withfal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les that came of the eayng of the vnrype Mandrag apples / agree with it / whiche he ſayd immediatly before the reherſall of the hete / that aryſeth of the eatyng of the row apples in theſe wordes. <hi>Ab aſſumpta Mandragora (niſi fal lar) caput nullo afficitur calore.</hi> The head is not vexed with any hete (except I be deceyued) after the takyng of Mandrage. Now whether that ſuch a forgetfull man as thys is ought ſo boldely to chek anciant autores or no as he doth at diuerſe tymes / let wyſe men &amp; lerned be iudges. But if he anſwer that he geueth only hete vnto the fruite / and not to the roote / beſyde that it may be ſayd vnto hym / that ſo much he accuſeth Dioſcorides vnworthely / as the hote withfalles come to / that come of the vnrype apples experience / is agaynſt hys accuſyng of Dioſcorides and the autorite of hym that had the ſame experience alſo. For in the booke that Serapio wrote of ſimples / Raſis / ſayeth theſe wordes: <hi>Dixerunt mihi quidam ex antiquis Babyloniae, quòd puella quaedam &amp;c.</hi> Certayn of the ancientes or old men of Babylon / haue tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de me that a certayn mayde eat fiue Mandrag apples / and that ſhe fell in a ſwowne / and that ſhe becam all rede / and that a man commyng by at that tyme / poured ſnow water ſo long vpon her heade vntill ſhe roſe agayn. And I haue ſene men my ſelfe whiche did eat of the roote of Mandrag to make them ſelues fat therwith / and it chanced vnto them / as it chanceth vnto men that go out of the bath and drynke muche wyne after theyr outgoyng. For their faces was excedyngly rede and ſwelled. Theſe wordes doth Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis write in the place aboue alledged. By which a man may learne that not only the vnrype appels of Mandragora driueth a man into a great heate outwardly / but alſo the rootes / ſo that it is euidently now perceyued both by autorite and experience / that Matthiolus was deceyued when he ſayd that nomans head was vexed with hete after the eatyng of Mandrago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra. Theſe haue writen ſom thyng at large to cauſe them that are to bold to old and worthy autores / to be aduiſed before they do ſo vnaduiſedly aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to do the ſame agayn. Serapio and Auicenna wryte that the ſede of Mandrag taken in drynk / clengeth the mother / and ſo wrote Dioſcorides of the ſame ſede many yeares before them / whereby it appereth that Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel knowyng the nature of the fruyte of Mandrag before all theſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters / for thys intent / deſyred to haue the fruite of Mandrag / that ſhe myght clenge her mother therwith / and thereby myght be made the fitter te con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue chylde her ſelfe as well as Lia her ſyſter / and Silfa her mayd dyd.</p>
                     <p>Mandrag as Paulus Egineta writeth cooleth in the thyrde degre. The ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ples of it / ſeme to haue ſom hea and moyſture / by reaſon where of they may bryng a man into an heuy ſlepe. But the bark of the root / is ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt of all / and cooleth not alone but alſo dryeth. The inner parte is weyker.</p>

It may be named in Engliſhe Tamariſk / becauſe as we want the buſhe / ſo alſo we haue no name for it in England. Myrica is of ij. kyndes as Dioſcorides writeth.

Theophraſt writeth that Myrica hath a fleſſhy or fat or thick lefe.

Which ſayng is not ſo to be vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that euery lefe by it ſelf were fat or fleſſhy: but that they are called fat / becauſe they grow ſo thyck together vpon the twygges. The leues of the Tamariſk are lyke the leues of Samin or of the Cypres tre / but they are ſom thyng leſſe. And both Dioſcorides and Pliny write that Erica whiche is called in the North parte of England hather or tyng / and in the South countre hethe / is lyke vnto Tamariſk. Wherefore ſeyng that there is no liknes at all betwene the rountre or quikbem / &amp; the hethe or hather / they haue ben far deceyued in London / which haue comenly vſed the barkes of quickbeme for Tamariſke as here after I intend to declare more at large. The Tamariſk buſhe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> groweth in Germany is about viij. foot long / and comenly it is not greater then a mans thum. The color of the bark in the vttermoſt parte of all is gray / and next vnto that / it is rede / but next vnto the wod it is yelow / as the wod is whilſe it is grene. The wod is very holow and hath very great pith / or hart / ſomthyng in that poynte ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke vnto cloder / or bourtre: The taſte of the barck is very byndyng / as the leues are alſo.</p>

Of thys Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riak kynde / the principall is freſhe / lyght / hauyng a large thyng reſemblyng hare / yelow in color / very well ſmellyng / and much lyke Cyperus in ſmell / with a ſhort eare / and a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taſte / which dryeth the tonge / becauſe it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tineweth long in the pleſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of hys ſmell.

Thys kynde by the reaſon of the grete moyſture of the place is weker in vertue / an hygher in lengthe / and it bryngeth furthe many ſpikes or hary eres out of one roote / folden in one iuſt to an other / of a very ſtrong ſauor. The Nardus of the mountayn ſauoreth better / and it hathe a ſhort eare / and cutted / the ſmell of it is lyke vnto Cyperus / and it hath all the other vertues of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Syriak.

Thus far Dioſcorides. Matthiolus and Amatus hys folower / do take muche labor to proue that the Spica nardi / that is the ear of Nardus is no eare growyng in the top of the ſtalke / but that it is the roote of Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus. And agaynſt all other that holde the contrari opinion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it gtoweth in the top / they inuey very ſharply / and namely agaynſt iij. greater clerkes then euer they haue bene or ar like to be / that is Hermolaus Barbarus / Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annes Ruellius / and Ioannes Manardus. Which allthoughe they erred / yet for theyr other truthes that they haue taught / all Europa deſerued to be handled ſomthyng gentlyer then theſe new correctores haue handled them. As for me I thynk that the ear groweth not in the top of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtalk / but
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18352:186"/> hard by the roote / ether partely in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grounde or very nere vnto the grounde / but I thynk rather that ſom parte of the ear groweth within the ground. Yet for all thys / I reken y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſpike can not be properly called a roote. And as for the place y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they alledge out of Galene de antidotis / in Galenis wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des they muſt ether vnderſtand Galene to calle the ſpike of Nardus vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a roote / or ellis they muſte in other places not only deny the autorite of Galene / but alſo of Philo / &amp; Dioſcorides alſo / which make an open diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione and difference betwene the roote of Nardus an the eare of the ſame: or ellis playnly deny that the ſpik is a root. Galene in the .ix. book <hi>de compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitione medicamentorum ſecundum locos</hi> alledgeth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preſeruatiue or antidot of Philo ij. verſes amongeſt many other / whiche ſeme playnly to deny that Nardus is a roote. The verſes are theſe: <q xml:lang="lat">
                        <l>Et drachmam dictae falſo radicis, ab ipſa</l>
                        <l>Terra, piſſae quae Ioue clara manet.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And Galene expoundyng theſe verſes / ſayeth theſe wordes folowynge: <hi>Quin &amp; Nardi ipſius drachmam vnam conijciendam cenſet, quam radicem falſo dictam appellat, quando quidem ſpica nardi verè nominatur.</hi> Alſo he iudgeth that a dram of Nardus muſt be put there to / which he calleth a falſely named roote / be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is truely named the ear or ſpike of Nardus. Dioſcorides alſo in the deſcription of the Nardus whiche is called gangitis / ſayeth that many ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes or eares com out of one roote / where vpon it foloweth playnly by the autorite of Dioſcorides that the ear of Nardus is not the root of Nardus. Therefore I reken that it is playn that the ſpica Nardi can not be properly called a roote / without the gaynſaying of Philo / Dioſcorides and Galene. Matthiolus layng to other mennes charges erneſtly many errours wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng vpon Nardus / is not very far from a manifeſt error if he be not wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped within it all redy. For he ſemeth to iudge that Nardus hath no ſtalk at all / and that therefore the ſpike or ear can not grow in the top of the ſtalk / which is not / or can no where be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. Hys wordes are theſe: <hi>Ego tametſi nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di quàm plurimum &amp;c.</hi> Allthough I haue examined &amp; picked out very much Nardus / in the ſhoppes of Venis / yet could I neuer fynd any thyng of Nardus there / ſauyng only the eare. Wherefore I thynk there can be found no Nardus which bryngeth furth the eares in the top. But what reaſon is thys / he ſeeth nothyng of Nardus but the eare / ergo Nardus hath nothyng ellis / becauſe he hath ſene no more. If thys be Matthioluſſes argument as he ſemeth at the leſte to go toward thys end: then it appeareth that Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus ſhould haue nether any ſtalk / nether any other root beſyde the eare / which is clene contrari vnto Dioſcorides / whome he taketh in hand to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde / who appoynteth both a ſtalk vnto Nardus / and alſo an other roote beſyde the ſpikes or eares to the ſame. And allthough in Germany there is not ſuche choyſe of ſimples in euery place as is in Venis / yet in thys yere of our lorde 1557. I found in the ſhop of Iacob Diter the Apothecari of Wiſeburg on pece of Nardus whiche hath a ſtalk a fynger long holow / and of the bygnes of a metely byg ſtraw / which I haue to ſhew at thys pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent daye. As touchyng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> roote of Nardus if that Matthiolus could fynde nothing of it / ſauyng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eare at Venis / I meruel where he found y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> litle roote that the eares grow one in hys figure whiche he hath ſet out in hys com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries vpon Dioſcorides. Amatus holdeth alſo ſtiffly that the ſpyke or
<pb facs="tcp:18352:187"/> ear of Nardus is alſo the roote. But it ſemeth by hys writyng both in the chapter of mew / and alſo in Nardus / that he ſhoulde meane that the ear of Nardus / ſhould be the nether parte of the roote of Nardus / for in both the chapters he compareth the root of ſpiknard with the roote of mew. And in bothe the places he ſayeth that the tufty rootes that ar very lyke ſpiknarde in Mew / grow in infima parte radicis / in the loweſt parte of the rootes. In the later place he ſayeth thus. Where as Dioſcorides ſayeth that Nardus putteth furth of one roote many eares that ſerueth for our purpos / whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as out of one principall roote as the mother of the reſt / many rootes as hary eares growyng one hard to an other / do ſpryng out / as a man may ſe the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke in the rootes of Mew / whoſe infinite rootes were diuided into eares that all that ſaw them / iudged them to be Spiknard. And a litle after he ſayeth / wherefore we ought to conclude that ther is no other roote found in Nardus / ſauyng the ſpike or eare. If he mean thus as by hys wrytyng he ſemeth to do / he is very far deceyued. For beſyde that I haue ſene a ſtalk im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly commyng from the ſpike (the ſtalk commeth neuer immediatly from the loweſt parte of the roote) Dioſcorides ſheweth that the Spikes com from one roote. The rootes allwayes in all plantes ar the loweſt &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moſt partes of them / then when as the Spikes com out of one roote / that roote muſt be lower and benethe the Spikes. Then the Spikes can not be the loweſt partes of the rootes / as he ſayeth that the tufty endes and loweſt partes of the rootes of Mew be. But where as he ſayeth that there is no other root ſauyng the Spike / I aſk them whether it is the maner of Dioſcorides to geue one thyng in one place ij. ſundry names / and to diſſeuer one thyng with ij. names when as the thyng is but one. If it be not hys maner ſo to do / then is hys gloſe brought in vayn / where as he ſayeth the the ſayng of Dioſcorides that many Spikes com out of one roote / is to be vnderſtand / that many rootes com out of one principal or mother roote: when as Dioſcorides in all hys hole worke neuer calleth a roote a Spike / nor a Spike a roote. As for the other error whiche he holdeth (or at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leſte he ſemeth to hold) with Matthiolus / that Nardus hath nether ſtalk ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther other roote then the eare / nede to make no other confuratione then it that a lytle aboue I haue made vnto Matthiolus for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame opinion. Then thys is my opinion of Nardus / that it hath a lytle roote in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grounde / out of the whiche the Spikes or eares ſpryng out / and I thynk that the loweſt partes of the eares at the leſte touche the ground / and that the ſtalke (as I haue ones ſene it) commeth out of the middes of the Spike or eare of blak rediſhe color / thin and holow within.</p>

Colu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mella in hys booke de re ruſtica ſayeth that Ornus is a wyld aſhe or an aſhe of the woldes / and that it hath no worſe bughes then the elm tre.

Theophraſt in hys thyrde booke of the hiſtori of plantes / in the eleuent chapter writeth of ij. kyndes of aſſhes / of the whiche the former kynde is in grete plenty in England / and it is called comonly an aſhe tre. But the ſecond kynde gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not in England that I know of. And if I be not deceyued it is called of the Latines namely of Virgil Ouid and Columella / Ornus or Fraxinus ſylueſtris. And Theophraſt wryteth of hys ſecond kynde of aſhe thus. The ſecond kynde of the aſſhes is lower and waxeth not ſo hyghe as the other / and is rougher / harder and yelower. The ſmothe aſhe groweth in low and holow places / and in watery places. But the roughe one groweth in dry &amp; rocky grounde. All that grow in playn groundes vſe to be playn &amp; ſmouthe. And all that grow in the mountaynes / vſe to be roughe ſcuruy or ſcabbed / with vnequal partes apperyng outward after the maner of ſcabbes. Thus far Theophraſt. That Ornus is a tre of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mountaynes / Virgill in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecond of hys Georgikes wytneſſeth in thys verſe:
<q xml:lang="lat">

Then when as Columella ſayeth that Ornus is Fraxinus montana / and Theophraſt ſayeth that the rockiſhe aſhe is of a yelow color / and the Germaynes walt aſcher / that groweth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mountay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes is yelow / I thynk that I may well conclude that the Germaynes rock aſhe or wod aſhe is Ornus of the Latines / and Fraxinus ſylueſtris Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſti is for the quicbeme / it groweth not in hygh and wild mountaynes / but in low and watery places / wherefore it can not be Ornus / or the ſecond kynde of aſhe in Theophraſt.</p>

The roote is a fynger thick. And when the ſtalk ſhrynkethe for dryues / it is like an holow pype. It is playn that thys herbe groweth amonge certayn pulſes / &amp; that it choketh &amp; ſtrangleth them / where of it hath the name of Orobanche / that is chokefitche or ſtrangletare. Thus far Dioſcorides of Orobanche. The herbe whiche I haue taken and taught xv. yeres ago to be Orobanche / which alſo now of late yeares Matthiolus hath ſet out for Orobanche / groweth in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d / bothe in the Northe countre beſyde Morpethe / whereas it is called our lady of new chapellis flour / and alſo in the South countre a lytle from ſheue in the broum cloſes. But it hath no name there. I haue ſene it in diuerſe places of Germany / and firſt of all betwene Colon and Rodekirch. The herbe is comenly a fout long and oft longer / I haue marked it many yeres / but I colde neuer ſe any lefe vpon it. But I haue ſene the floures in diuerſe places of diuerſe colores / and for the moſte parte where ſo euer I ſaw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / they were rediſhe or turnyng to a purple color in ſom places / but in figure they were lyke vnto to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> floures of Clare with a thyng in them repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentyng a cockis hede. The roote is round and much after the faſſhon of a grete lekis hede / and there grow out of it certayn long thynges lyke ſtryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which haue in them in certayn places ſharp thynges lyke tethe / where with it claſpeth and holdeth the roote that it ſtrangleth. I haue found it oft tymes claſpyng &amp; holdyng meruellouſly ſoft the rootes of brou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / ſo that they looked as they had ben bound foulde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oft about with ſmall wyre.

I found the rootes of Orobanche faſt claſped about y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rootes of the clauer / which as I did playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceyue / draw out all the natural moyſture from the herbe that it ſhould haue lyued with all / and ſo killed it / as yui and dodder in continuance of tyme do with the trees and herbes that they fould and wynde them ſelues about. They that holde that cuſcuta or doder is Orobanche in Dioſcorides / ar far deceyued. For Orobanche is a ſtalk and not a lace as doder is. Oro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banche is but a fout and an half long / but the laces of dodder will be ſom

The ſtalk of Orobanche is hollow when it is withered / but ſo is not the ſtalk or rather the lace of doder. The ſtalke of Orobanche is roughe / but the lace of doder is very ſmothe. Wherefore they were very far ouerſene which now of late haue writen that doder is Orobanche in Dioſcorides.

Orobanche as Galene writeth is colde and dry in the firſte degre. Matthiolus ſayethe that Orobanche is called in Italian lupa / that is a wolfe and alſo herba tora / that is herbe bull / becauſe that if a cow chanſe to eate of it / ſhe rynneth ſtreyght way after to the bull. But it that Matthio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus wryteth agaynſt Theophraſt / becauſe he ſayeth that Orobanche kylleth Orobus and ſtrangleth it with hys preſſyng in / or thryſtyng together / and that Orobanche killeth pulſes only with hys preſence / pleaſeth me not / as a ſayng agaynſt reſon autorite and experience. It is agaynſt reſon that only the preſence of Orobanche ſhould kill pulſes / ſeyng it is no venummus herbe / when euen venummus herbes kill not them amongeſt whome they grow except they touche them / or be ſo thyk amongeſt them that they take the noriſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from them / whereby they ſhould lyue.

Now I pray yow how can Orobanche ſtrangle it that it toucheth not? Belyke Matthiolus ſaw no leues in Orobanche nor any claſpers aboue the grounde / &amp; therefore he thought that there was no other thyng that Orobanche had / where with it colde ſtrangle / &amp; neuer marked y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> litle ſtrynges in the roote / whiche not with out a faut hys Orobanche wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth / and ſo cam into thys error that Orobanche ſtrangled only with hys preſence.

And as touchynge experience / I know that the freſhe and yong Orobanche hath commyng out of the great roote / many lytle ſtrynges ſuch as we ſe in a phrone or ſe ſterr / but longer / wherewith it taketh holde of the rootes of the herbes that grow next vnto it. Wherefore Matthiolus ought not ſo lyghtly to haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced the autorite of Theophraſt ſo ancient and ſubſtantiall autor / with laiyng ignorance vnto hys charge / ſeyng that Theophraſtus in the ſame place where he ſpeaketh of Orobanche telleth playnly that ſum herbes ar firſt ſtrangled by the roote / and that not the only preſence of ſuche wedes kill herbes and pulſes / but the takyng away of theyr noriſhement

Where of we haue hearde a grete wonder / that is to wete / that that ſame kynde dieth &amp; lyueth agayn by it ſelf / as the byrd called Phenix dothe / whiche is ſuppoſed to haue receyued hyr name of thys kinde of Date tre / for the cauſe aboue reherſed. And whilſe as I wrote theſe thynges that ye now rede / it brought furth fruite. The fruite of it is grete / hard / roughe &amp; illfauored to looke to / and differeth from all other kyndes by a wild rammi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhe and rank taſte that it hath. The which ſame thynges we haue allmoſte perceyued to be in bores / and thys is the moſte euydent cauſe of the name of it. There ar other Dates that grow about the hygher partes of Ethiopia / called cariote / which haue in them muche meate and muche iuice / where of the men of the Eaſte / make their chefe wines. But they ar euel for the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach / where of they haue theyr name.

There ar ſum kyndes of Dates called dactyli / and they ar of the dryer ſorts / and they ar long and ſmall and ſomthyng croked. Dates in Ethiopia ar broken into pouder (ſuch is the drought there) and after the maner of mele they ar thicked vp and of them brede is made. The Date there / groweth in a buſhe that hath branches / a cubit long / a brode lefe / a round fruite / but greter then an apple / they call them cycas. They wax ripe in thre yeres / and there is allwayes one Date vpon the buſhe / &amp; other groweth vnder the ſame. They ar fitteſt to be kept that grow in ſaltiſhe and ſandy groundes / as in Iewry and in Africa about Syrene. But they can not be kept in Egypt / Cyprus / Syria / Seleucia / &amp; therefore they fede ſwyne and other beſtes with them. Many of Alexandres ſouldyers was ſtrangled with grene Dates. And that chanced in Gedroſis by a certayn kynde of fruite / but in other places it chanceth by the reſon of the grete plenty. The leues of the Date tre neuer fall of.</p>

Allthough theſe great learned men and of no ſmall autorite in theyr countres / where as they do dwell: yet in thys matter I do not agre with them. The firſt cauſe that maketh me diſſent from them is thys / that Dioſcorides vſeth not in all hys booke that I remembre / to write in two chapters far one from an other / of any gardine and felde herbe or plant / but euer where as he maketh mention of the gardin herbe / he maketh mention alſo of the felde herbe in the ſame chapter or in the next folowyng or there about.

Hys firſt argument is thys / populeum is iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of the moſt learned men to be colde about the thyrde degre / ergo the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler is colde. Thys argument is not good / becauſe a lytle portion of an hote thyng may go in to a colde compoſion / to lead the colde medicines to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſed places / or to correct or tempere the vehemencie of vnholſum cold ſim<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ples / and yet it is not therfore neceſſari that the hote medicine ſhuld be colde for beyng me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged with many cold medicines. Nether is it neceſſari that the cold compoſition ſhuld be made hote with a ſmall portion of an hote ſimple medicine. If he had reſoned thus: the beſt learned men iudge / that the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler is cold about the thyrde degre / ergo they erre that hold that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> popler is hote / had bene a good argument. But the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wold I haue denyed his antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent / &amp; haue ſayd / that Galene / Aetius / Paulus / Oribaſius / Serapio &amp; Aui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenna / wer better learned then euer they wer that hold that the popler is ſo cold. For it is a falſe fallacie and a ſophiſticall argument to argue from a parte to the hole. As thus there is ſum parte of the horſe is whyte / ergo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> horſe is whyte or all whyte. And euen ſuch argument is thys. If populus were hote then ſhuld populeum be hote: but it is cold / ergo populus is cold. When as ther go in to the oyntme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t populeum only xviij. vnces of the pople budes / there entre in xxxiij. vnces of all very cold herbes / which by many
<pb facs="tcp:18352:224"/> vnces ouercom the weike hete of the popler buddes / and ſo abyde cold ſtill / namely when as the poplers hete / is but in the firſt degre / and the coldnes of the other / is cold for the moſte parte of them all in the ſecond or thyrde degre / and ſom of them be colde almoſt in the fourthe degre. And therefore it foloweth not. Populeum is veri colde / ergo populus which is a parte of it is alſo colde. But thys is one great cauſe of his error / that he dyd not conſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre / that learned men did put ſumtymes ſum portiones of hote ſimples in to medicines that take ache away / not to make the hole compoſition hote / but to conuey the other colde ſimples into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſeaſed places. Whiche thyng Galene teacheth in the ix. booke of the compoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of medicines after the places / in theſe wordes. <hi>Ex opij &amp; hyoſciami mixtura, ſomnum ſopori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferum, &amp; ſenſitiuae partis ſtuporem inducere voluit.

Hys ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t goeth furthe thus. Galene / Pau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lus and Conſtantinus wryte that the popler is but hote in the firſt degre / er<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>go it is colde or not hote: but thys argument is ſo vnlearnedly made / that it nedeth but ſmall confutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. When as he ought by good logike to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned / the olde wryters hold that populus nigra is hote in the firſte degre / ergo it is hote / and in nowyſe colde. For to be hote in the firſt degre / is to be one degre ſtop or order departed from it that is temperat or colde. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Galene wrytyng of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heate of thys tre / ſayeth in theſe expreſſed wordes. The floures of the blak popler ar hote in workyng / in the firſt departyng or goyng away / or degre from temperat ſymples / that is to ſay from ſuch as ar in a meane te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pre betwene hote and colde. Therefor / ſeynge that he maketh hys concluſion / contrari vnto hys antecedent / that is an hote antecedent / &amp; a cold conſequent / his argument is worthy to be refuſed.</p>
                     <p>Hys thyrde argument is thys: The popler tre hathe nether any notable ſmell nor taſte in it / where by it may be iudged to be hote / ergo it is no wyſe hote. Here I deny hys antecedent or ground of hys argument / and I take wytnes of all learned men that haue taſted and ſmelled of the yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g buddes of the blak popler / wheter they haue very pleaſant ſmell and an hote taſte or no. I anſwer that the popler buddes / which I haue taſted and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned / both in England / Germany and Italy / ar hote / and that the gum that commeth furth of the endes of buddes / is hote about the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d degre / &amp; thys ſhall any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that will try it / fynde true / namely at the firſt commyng furth of the buddes / about the myddes of marche / &amp; in ſum contrees ſoner.

But when as ſpinus ſemeth to haue the name of prickes / that tre that hath mani prickes and beareth plummes / may well be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſpinus / whether it be wilde or tame. Alſo as there ar many kyndes of gardin plummes as Pliny hath tolde vs before: and experience doth tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che: ſo ar there alſo diuerſe kyndes of wilde plumbes and plum trees. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of I know two ſeuerall kyndes at the leſte. The one is called the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les tre or the bulleſtertre / and the other is called the ſlo tre or the blak thorn tre. The bulles tre is of two ſortes / the one is remoued in to gardines / and groweth to the bygnes of a good byg plum tre. The other groweth
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18352:227"/> in hedges / but it neuer groweth in to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bygnes of any grete tre / but abideth betwene the bygnes of a tre and a great buſhe. I neuer ſaw in all my lyfe more plenty of thys ſorte of bulles trees / then in So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>merſet ſhyre. Thys leſſe bulles tre hat mo prickes then the greater hath / wherefore it deſerueth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be called ſpinus for the names ſake then the greter bulles tre dothe.</p>
                  <p>And ſo the ſlo tre hauyng yet mo prickes / then ether of bothe hathe / may better be called ſpinus then any of them bothe may be namely wher as w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the other / it beareth plumbes in form and taſte lyke to the other ſortes. But Cornarius holdeth contrary to the iudgement of all learned men of our age y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our comon ſlo buſhe is not ſpinus or prunus ſylueſtris / becauſe it is not a greate tre able to be grafted in. For Palladius ſayeth he maketh ſpinum to be a tre able to be grafted in. But ſeyng that the ſlo buſhe is not byg inough to be grafted in / it can not be ſpinus. Thys argument doth folow very euel / for allthoughe Palladius iudgethe one ſpinum mete to be grafted in: yet for all that he maketh not euery ſpinum able to be grafted in. For nether he nor Virgill deny y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther is any wilde kynde of ſpinus which may not be grafted in for litlenes. Nay it appeareth by Virgil y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he taketh our ſlo buſhe for the wild ſpino / whilſe he writeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſpineta do hyde the lyſertes in the hete of ſommer. But ſpinetu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name in thys place of Virgill / nether of ſpina that is a thiſtel / for lyſertes vſe not to hyde them amongeſt thyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telles / &amp; ſpina ſignifieth not a whyte hawthorn tre in good writers / except alba be put vnto it / ye &amp; that only in Columella that I remembre. Spine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum can nether com of the gardin ſpino / nor of the great wild / ſpino for they vſe not to grow in any place ſo thyk together that the numbre of them may be called ſpinetum / and ſo can not hyde the liſertes from the heat of the ſon. Therfore ſeyng that ſpinetum is a thicket of ſpinis / and is nether of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis herbaceis nether of the plumb trees / nether of the great wild ſpinis / it is lyke that he maketh his ſpinetum of our ſpinis ſylueſtribus minoribus / which ar ſlo buſhes. And thys my opinion may well be confirmed / by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>paryng of Theocritus &amp; Virgil together.

To whoſe writing ſom of the later Grecianes do not fully conſent / and namelye in the deſcriptiones of Oxilapathi and Oxalidos / for ſom of the later Grecianes ſeme to take Oxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapathum / as though it had the name of the ſour and ſharp taſte / and not of the ſharpnes of the ouermoſte part of the top of the leafe. Aetius in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the falling ſicknes / writeth theſe wordes after the tranſlacion of Cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>narius of Oxalis: Oxallidem ſiue rumicem acutum / viridem preſertim quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidie dato a primo luna vſque ad trigeſtimam / in whiche wordes he ſemeth to confound and make all one of Oxilapathum and Oxalis. The ſame Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius writeth thus of Oxalis in the healing of the iaundes. Oxalis eſt rumex acri ſapore / folijs ranulis et folijs caude quadrangulari / &amp;c. Ye may ſe that Aetius geueth here vnto the taſt of Oxalis ſharpnes / wyth bytinge as this worde Acris doth ſignifie / &amp; a four cornered ſtalke / whereof nether of both Dioſcorides geueth vnto his Oxalis / nether to his Oxilapatho. As for my parte I do not remember that euer I ſawe anye ſuch ſorel as Aetius deſcri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beth.

There is an other kind of Dockes that groweth in moyſte and watery grounde / with a leafe muche rounder then it that I ſpake laſt of / it hath a very ſoure taſte lyke ſorel / and this do I take for Oxalapatho of Aetij and other of hys tyme.</p>
                  <p>We haue two kindes of wild Dockes / the one with the form and lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of plantayn / whych groweth in middowes and in bare grenes / and an other kind with a leafe not much vnlyke the leafe of Aran: and ſo many kin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des haue we alſo of Oxalis or Sorell / for the one hath a rounder leafe / and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other ſharper / w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſharpe thinges reſembling abrode arrow head.

It hath leaues and braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches lyke Organe / called of ſom wilde Mergerum / but whyter:
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:18352:260"/> but if it be ſet about hedges / it groweth more luſtely: the other kind is wild / and is called zigis. This doth not crepe / but ſtandeth right vp / and it put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth furth ſmall ſtalkes / after the maner of a vind / whych are full of leaues lyke vnto rue / but the leaues are narrower / longer and harder / the floures haue a bytinge taſte / the ſmell of it is very pleaſante / the roote is nothynge wurth. It groweth more ſtronger in rockes / and it is hoter / then it of the gardine / and is fitter for phyſick. But Pliny wryteth thus of Serpillum: Men thynke that it hath the name of ſerpendo / that is of crepinge / whyche thynge it chanſeth in the wilde / and ſpeciallye vpon rockes / the gardine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillum crepeth not / but groweth vnto the hyght of a ſpan: it is fatter that groweth of hys owne will / and hath whyter leaues and boughes / and it is good agaynſt ſerpentes: Hetherto Pliny. Nowe ye ſe the contrary iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe two greate learned men / wherof the one ſayeth the gardin ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pillum crepeth not / but groweth ryght vp. It is harde to tell to whether of theſe a man ſhould ſtick: the authorite of Dioſcorides moueth me to ſtande of hys ſyde / but ſom experience as I ſhall declare hereafter / maketh me ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leane vnto Pliny / for as I haue ſeldom ſene anye ſerpillum / though it had ben brought ſurth of the feldes / and ſet in the gardine / crepe and take routes from the ioyntes of the braunches: ſo I neuer ſawe anye in the felde that grew alltogether ſtreyght vp / from the ground ſpecially / if it were of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny age / but dyd alwayes crepe and grow along by the grounde: howbeit I grant that euen the wilde ſerpillum / when as it bringeth furth hys top and floure / hath a litle ſtalke aboue the ground about vj. inches longe / or therab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: it is poſſible that Dioſcorides loking vpon the wilde ſerpillum / about y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyme of flouringe / and not conſidering it at other tymes / dyd therefore geue ſentence that the wilde ſerpillum dyd not crepe / but that it of the gardine ſhould crepe / and take routes in the grounde at the ioyntes / it is contrarye to my experience / except he mean of ſuch as is brought from the feldes / and is planted in the gardin / for allthough it buſheth largely / and groweth ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng aſyde / yet it faſtneth very ſeldom any rootes in the grounde / whereof the cauſe maye be / that the gardineres will not let it growe ſo long / that it maye crepe vpon the ground / and ſo will not ſuffer it to take roote. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo lyke it that Pliny calleth the ſmall kind of tyme / that is comon in our gar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dines in Englande / ſerpillum hortenſe / and if that be his meaninge / then is hys opinion very true / for that neuer crepeth. And that there are two kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of tyme / and not one alone as ſom holde / wherof Pliny may call the one ſerpillum hortenſe / theſe wordes of Dioſcorides in Epitimo beare wytnes. Epithymum is the floure of an harder thyme / and lyke vnto ſauery. Plinye alſo maketh two kindes of thyme / but he diuideth them not as Dioſcorides doth / but he diuideth the one into the whyter / and the other into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blacker / where as Dioſcorides diuideth thys thymes into the harder / whych is grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter / and into the ſofter and leſſe kinde / wherefore the leſſe and ſofter kinde may be the gardine ſerpillum of Pliny / &amp; no kinde of Plinyes thymes.

Ether Matthiolus knoweth not the ryght ſyon / or ellis I knowe it not. For the Sion that I knowe / hath not ſede in litle coddes / but in the toppe after the maner of aniſe / and the roote is not lyke the rootes of water creſſes. I am far deceyued / except the figure that Matthiolus ſetteth out / be not lyke the monſtre that Horace maketh mention of / whych hath a mannis head / ſet vpon a horſe neck / and many diuerſe fethers vpon them / for I haue gone thorow England / hygh Germany and low Germany / and a great deale of Italy / where as I ſought diligentlye all kindes of herbes / but I could neuer fynde yet any ſuch herbe / as Matthiolus ſetteth furth for ſion / for his ſion hath the verye true rootes and coddes of water creſſes / whych neuer man / as I thynke dyd ſe in ſion. Let men that are learned in the hiſtory of herbes iudge / whether I iudge ryght or no.</p>
                  <p>There are two kindes of herbes beſyde this / wherof the greater is in all thynges / ſauinge the bignes is like vnto ſion / the other kinde is of a cubite hyght / and hath leaues verye lyke perſelye in figure / ſauinge that they are a great deal bigger. I iudge that thys kinde is called of Pliny ſilans / whyche as he ſayeth / <hi>naſcitur in glareoſis &amp; perennibus fluuijs, apij ſimilitudine.</hi>

For Theophraſt ſayeth: <hi>Tribuli duo ſunt genera, vnus folio exit ciceris, alter ſpino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus conſtat foliatus, ambo terreni.</hi> Lo here Theophraſt maketh one kinde of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus terreſtris that hath pricky leaues: therefore tribulus allthough it can not be a bramble / yet it may be a thiſtell.
